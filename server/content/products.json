        "review": "Keyboard:\nI've come to like the chicklet style keys and it's good to see them turning up as full sized keyboards. This keyboard is very nice to type on... the keys are spaced so that my hands just naturally land on home row and the board is fairly slender from front to back which means no wild reaching for keys. Another nice part of this board is that it's fairly close to the table top; you won't need a stepladder to reach the keys. Overall this leads to a comfortable and fast typing scenario that is surprisingly good for an inexpensive membrane keyboard.\n\nOn the down side this board is rather noisy. The centre front of the keyboard is a bit flexible, with a hard plastic \"leg\" that's a bit too short and it will bounce off the table when typing. I put mine on a rubber pad and it's now acceptably quiet.\n\nThe casing of this keyboard is easy to flex and bend. On one hand this lets us flex it a little to get it sitting flat on the table, on the other it's not very rigid while typing. I don't think this is a strength issue so it's unlikely you'll break it but you should expect it to flex a bit when picking it up or moving it.\n\nMouse:\nThe mouse from this package is pretty nice. It's fast and agile. Repeated back and forth movements land in about the same place every time so you aren't constantly picking it up to reset the cursor position. The buttons have a positive click to them so there's no doubt when they've been pressed, which should reduce button down errors. The wheel is quiet and smooth to use with a third button underneath.\n\nOn the down side this mouse is very light. It's almost impossible to roll the wheel without moving the mouse, unless you are holding it in place. The cord is a bit on the short side as well. It should have been the same length as the keyboard cord.\n\nOverall:\nA good deal for the price.\nBoth pieces are well made and operate as expected."

It has helped to free up additional desk space in my home office and allow for better ergonomics. The device is easy to assemble and it has two adjustable heights, allowing me to customize it to whatever my workspace needs are. It has a non-skid surface so my laptop doesn't slide off and the legs have a wide enough base to fit my bigger laptop. The price was very reasonable and I am happy to recommend this product."

        "review": "The AmazonBasics Wired Keyboard and Wired Mouse Bundle Pack is a commendable offering for those seeking a straightforward and budget-friendly solution to their input needs. While not groundbreaking, this bundle serves as a reliable and practical addition to any workstation.\n\nThe keyboard, with its familiar layout and tactile keys, offers a comfortable typing experience. Its simplicity is its strength, making it ideal for both casual users and professionals seeking a no-nonsense input device. The keys are responsive and provide a satisfying click, enhancing typing speed and accuracy. However, don't expect advanced features like customizable macros or RGB lighting - this bundle aims to provide the essentials.\n\nPaired with the keyboard, the wired mouse maintains the same philosophy of functionality over frills. Its ergonomic design fits comfortably in hand, making extended usage less strenuous. The tracking is smooth and accurate, suitable for everyday tasks and casual gaming. Once again, it's worth noting that this mouse isn't meant for heavy gamers or those looking for extensive customization options.\n\nWhat truly sets this bundle apart is its unbeatable value. The combination of a reliable keyboard and a serviceable mouse at this price point is hard to beat. It's an excellent choice for students, home offices, or anyone who doesn't require extravagant features. Plus, the wired connection ensures minimal latency, a boon for users who prioritize responsiveness.\n\nIn summary, the AmazonBasics Wired Keyboard and Wired Mouse Bundle Pack is a testament to the adage \"simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" It's not aiming to redefine the market, but rather to provide a dependable, cost-effective solution for those seeking basic input devices. If you're in need of an unpretentious yet reliable keyboard and mouse combo, this bundle is well worth considering."

        "review": "Keyboard Pros:\n- All aluminum construction. It's got a little bit of bow but not enough that even the heaviest typer will notice. Overall build quality is borderline excellent.\n- Included dongle range is good. I don't have direct line of site and where it sits it's blocked on 3 sides with a cold rolled steel 15u server. The only escape is tempered glass on the front and 10 feet away it doesn't miss a keystroke.\n- Keys, although chicklet style, are very usable. This wont help you play fortnite better, but it's good for typing. There not a lot of horizontal shift in the keys and they don't feel at all mushy. They bounce up good enough that you don't need to slow down your typing.\n- Battery life seems good. The fact you can recharge the battery is a great bonus at this price point.\n- On/Off switch which conserves battery life and makes it so my year and a half old wont mash the keys when I'm getting him cheerios.\n\nKeyboard Cons:\n- Could have used a backlight. Not something too much to complain about at this price point, but would be nice.\n- It's a little thin on the bottom. Another inch or so of material would give lap typers somewhere to put their hands when they are typing. I can see they were going for small and minimalist but anyone who's got a PC hooked up to a tv will tell you, a little extra palm and wrist support goes a long way.\n\nMouse Pros:\n- Still rechargeable\n- Works I guess?\n- On/Off button\n\nMouse Cons:\n- Not at all ergonomic. Long term use for a heavy computer user would easily cause finger injuries from the shape of the mouse.\n- Unlike the keyboard the mouse feels like an afterthought. It's great it's included and doesn't require an extra dongle to use, but it feels cheap. Clicks sound weird and the scroll mouse doesn't allow for fluid scrolling and instead only allows step scrolling.\n- no extra buttons to speak of. Usually even a cheap $10 mouse these days has a forward and back button.\n- Giant hole where the dongle used to be on the bottom. Very easy to get crud buildup in. Not a great design.\n- SO lightweight. Where the keyboard is a fairly heavy slab by keyboard standards, the mouse weights practically nothing at all.\n\nIn conclusion, the keyboard is a great buy on its own. Its attractive looking, and easy to type on. The solid build quality is great at this price point and should stand up to minor abuse without issue. The stuff is very easily plug and play on most systems and range is good and accurate. The mouse is a mess. It's good to have included just in case your real mouse dies and the fact it uses the same dongle is great for people who tend to lose small pieces. I switched it out with my favorite wireless mouse (Logitech MX Master 3) which is an unfair comparison at almost $130. But pretty well anything short of an Amazon Basics mouse would probably be a step up on this one.\n\nI really like the keyboard. And for the sub-$50 category, this is an excellent value. The mouse would be nothing more than an emergency mouse but again, it's nice that something is included in the box. This may be the first sub-$50 keyboard that I would give a buy to as long as you're not looking mechanical feel or cherry mx. It's a no-frills clean design that I'm sure I'll use for a while."

        "review": "Having bought and returned 3 other brands of keyboard (including name brand Logi) this 4th attempt didn't really fill me with promise. But of all the keyboards I tried, this is the best one. It has good weight and the included mouse is low profile, comfortable, and absolutely silent. I was used to my Dell compact keyboard and wanted one like that -- a solid feeling but quiet keystroke, with a good layout and a quiet comfortable mouse to go along with it. This combo ticked almost all the boxes. The one thing I don't care for is that they arranged the Del/Home/PgUp/PgDn/End keys vertically between the main key panel and the numeric pad. Which would have been fine, but it's done at the expense of making the Backspace, Enter, and Shift keys less wide than normal. I make a lot of mistakes so I use the Backspace key quite a bit and this is somewhat annoying, but the rest of the keyboard makes up for it. All in all, the best one I've tried in this price range and I think it's a keeper. One other note: it has dedicated function keys but doesn't have the custom function keys of some others so I can't quickly put the computer to sleep or pop up the web browser with a single key."

        "review": "I teach online and have worked in IT my whole adult life. I get Apple keyboards and trackpads for the Macs, and usually Logitech for the PCs. To keep this short, this JOYACCESS set replaced a Logitech set that is only a few months old. The mouse was constantly lagging from about day 2, and to be honest, I am so used to scissor-switch keyboards, I was thinking about getting a replacement. After I left the Logitech mouse at another house, I needed a quick replacement and ordered this JOYACCESS set, not expecting much except for next-day delivery. At a fraction of the cost of an equivalent Logitech set, it turned out to be far superior. The keyboard is perfect, scissor-switch joy, and I really like that the keys are also textured (as opposed to smooth like an Apple keyboard). It is built just like an Apple keyboard, so it earns points for aesthetics, too. I don't particularly like the END key to the right of the right arrow, only because I use that arrow often, and end up hitting the END key instead. The compact Apple keyboard does not have an END key (whereas the full-sized Apple and the Logitech do), and I think that it could be safely eliminated (just a suggestion).\n\nFinally, the mouse is my absolute favorite, EVER! It hasn't lagged, which was my biggest complaint with the Logitech mouse, but beyond stellar connectivity, it is the most responsive mouse I've used, and I do mean \"ever.\" The DPI switch/button was new to me, and the only thing I would recommend would be for JOYACCESS to include some information about that feature in the literature included with the set. Being able to adjust the sensitivity was a bonus I had not expected, and finally I have the perfect setup. The monitor and even the computer shown were also purchased on Amazon, but I'm leaving a review for the lowest cost purchase because this mouse and keyboard are outstanding. After all these years, I've got a new go-to keyboard/mouse brand, and after all that, I suppose I should get back to work."

The RGB lights and remote are a cool cosmetic touch. Entry inside the computer is also easy for when you install a graphics card or whatever you're adding. It's quiet, doesn't make a lot of heat. Even without a graphics card it still runs some pretty big games like Albion, World of War craft, Dungeons and Dragons Neverwinter. Mouse and keyboard while simple also have RGB components work and look nice together.\n\nCons\n\nI was under the impression that I was purchasing a gaming computer...and I'm not too exactly sure what makes this pc a gaming pc other than the RGB lights...it doesn't come with a graphics card, have to buy a low profile graphics card separately and unless you know about graphics cards that may be confusing, however they DO claim that it didn't have one. Quite honestly aside from not having a graphics card to play more demanding games, I can't think of any other complaints to review about.\n\nAt the end of the day I bought this pc because it was low price and and claimed to have gaming components. It can certainly runs like a breeze and can be upgraded to handle higher end games, can still play basic low requirement games, even some bigger games at its base form."

If you do want to use it for gaming you will have to drop about another $50 -$75 for 8gb of RAM to run minimum requirements for almost all current games. Then you can expect to spend another $350- $900 on a video card for it to even open any game besides solitaire. I wasted time and money. I should have just purchased a gaming PC directly from TigerDirect, etc. I'm going to end up spending more to get non-gaming gaming PC to any type of specs where it could be used for games than just purchasing one that is set up for it to begin with. I wish I could give zero stars."

I would love to buy a wrist rest for this keyboard then it would be perfect.\n\nThe switches sound great, slightly airy but that's typical for cherry's. Very smooth actuation, and also not a loud keyboard at all. My Corsair K70 with brown switches blows this out of the water when it comes to sound. That is not a bad thing though. Just be aware it's quite a bit quieter than other mechanical keyboards.\n\nNot to mention this keyboard is damn attractive. Once you get some lighting going with aura sync it's even better."

Oddly the sample code I found didn't include the button on the Joystick down press button, see my list below. I didn't care I was just looking for confirmation of the PINs because it's actually Pin 2-8 and A0, A1. I'm really happy they didn't leave anything on D0/1 for the serial port.. The joystick will show you difficultly to read a value other than mid-point (spring return value) to full or minimum range. If you move it a little into mid-span value if you creep into the movement. Full scale readings are present after about 1/2 through the full range of motion. I ended up just integrating my value and it was fine. A person could de-solder and replace this joystick but in my experience these types of joysticks are kid of low quality anyways.\n\nThere are no other peripherals on this board outside of the joystick with pushdown button and the six buttons. There are three breakout headers and then the pin headers for prototyping.\n\nHere is the inputs:\n#define BUTTON_UP 2\n#define BUTTON_RIGHT 3\n#define BUTTON_DOWN 4\n#define BUTTON_LEFT 5\n#define BUTTON_1 6\n#define BUTTON_2 7\n#define BUTTON_XY 8\n#define PIN_ANALOG_X 0\n#define PIN_ANALOG_Y 1"

In addition to Jon's review I wrote a simple sketch to test all the pins. This is what I found:\n\nI tried both boards--everything I found was true for both thus all bugs are actually features.\n\n1. The four coloured buttons come up on pins D2 - D5\n2. The two small momentary buttons are on pins D6, D7\n3. The joystick Y-axis does indeed come up on A0 but is highly susceptible to noise and pressure from pushing the buttons. This results in large voltage fluctuations when not it use and inconsistent min-max values when in use. Push the Y-axis to max or min and the voltage will slowly creep back toward the centre value.\n4. The joystick X-axis does not come up on A1. Rather A1 is a V+ (i.e. more sensitive with clipping) version of the Y-axis. I found no X-axis output on the board.\n5. As there is no documentation (and the product is not mentioned at all on the HiLetgo website leading me to believe that this is not actually made by that company,) there is no way to know how to interface with the NRF24L01 or the Nokia LCD or know which pins they interface with. I could have done some continuity testing but, since the joystick was unusable, I decided to forgo any further waste of my time.\n6. As mentioned by Jon, the bluetooth and I2C headers are non-existent.\n7. The board mounted voltage toggle switch is finicky at best and had to be held in the 3.3v position in order to maintain connection. The 5v position worked fine.\n\nReturned; I guess I'll make my own."

The little knob that allows you to adjust the height/level becomes unable to stay up and it slants down to a useless angle, dropping your mouse and keyboard.\n\nIn the beginning it was only occasionally when I was using it, and I always tried not to push too hard when using my mouse and keyboard. Despite my efforts, over time, this got worse and worse. The last few weeks it will only hold at an inward angle, and now, it won't hold at all, and the little knob is basically useless. It broke a part of my expensive ergonomic keyboard, when it decided to randomly drop while I was in another room, dropping my mouse and keyboard.\n\nI always undid the knob when readjusting, and tried my best to take care of the product when using it. It lacks durability, and is not ideal for work from home when being used for long periods.\n\nI contacted the seller before writing this review, and they replied by only citing the 30 day return policy and saying they cannot help me as it has passed. Completely unhelpful. I would rather a replacement part be sent out, but that option was not even offered.\n\nPlease see the photos, and be warned, this is not a high quality, durable keyboard tray."

The adjustable knob fell out for one of our Ergotron underdesk keyboard units and the manufacturer did not provide a replacement knob (or bolt), so we started looking for options.

The Ergotron unit was easier to adjust, but this unit swivels left and right, and also has a nice rubber wrist support on the keyboard tray. Only other downside would be the roller mechanism.

You can pretty much guess how to setup so no real need of course to waste time reading instructions :D\n\nHaving read the review about the keyboard sliding, I am guessing that person’s keyboard doesn't have silicon or rubber stands on it. As my Logitech keyboard is not moving anywhere.\nAs you can see from the pictures there is plenty of room for mouse and keyboard, even got my wrist support on it.\n\nMy MX2s mouse glides across the top which is great.\n\nBoard slides in and out nicely and stays in place as well.

        "review": "As a keyboard shelf its great. Although it said its 70cm. Yes. It is. But the clamps are much further apart. Fortunately the desk i was attaching it to was around a cm narrower than the wing to wing measurements so the clamps go right on the edge.\n\nIt seems sturdy although plastic. My only frustration is on placing a keyboard on it slides around like ice. The mouse you dont mind slip because you move it. But it would be nice if the keyboard did not. I contemplated getting some fake leather and gluing it on the shelf but at £70 if that wrecks it that would be disappointing.\n\nSlightly unsure right now how to address the moving keyboard issue. As the slightest hand movement moves the keyboard"

        "review": "Let me preface this with, this product is not bad for the price point. It works as a functioning computer for low end gaming (Roblox, Among Us etc) and everyday use. As someone who likes to run high graphics action packed games(CoD, GTA, other newer games with high graphics requirements or FPS)-this does not do it for me. I’ve also been having some minor issues with the colors inverting when a game is in full screen, it’s a simple fix by opting to not use windows optimization. My biggest issue with this is windows 11 is not supported on this desktop. It is not up to Microsoft’s standards and this cannot be upgraded to windows 11. That’s not a big deal right now as most things will run on windows 10 I’m just concerned for the longevity of this product. I knew this was a refurbished piece however I was not expecting the pc to be 5 years old, according to the pc specs from the PC Heath app. This pc also does not have an HDMI port thankfully there are 2 DP ports so I can plug both my GTek monitors into. Like I said this pc will do what is needed with some pretty decent low volume gaming but if you want to stream/use dual monitors/play high end or action games I do not recommend this… For some context of my comparison: my Lenovo laptop with AMD processing can run more of these higher quality games with fewer issues, and I find myself questioning if I will continue to use this desktop or just plug my laptop in with my 2 monitors.\n\n**UPDATE**\nSo I gave this a fair shot for about 2months… I gave up after trying to make this work and even upgraded some of the internal parts! I ultimately went and purchased a much better gaming PC. With this pc, not only did the Wi-Fi stop working all together and require an Ethernet cable, I could no longer turn it on… the saying “you get what you pay for” is clearly expressed here. BUYER BEWARE: save your money, this is not worth the price…."

I purchased this set because I've been getting a lot of connection drops with my usb mouse due to a loose internal wire. This Amazon Basics set is nice. I like the tilt level of the keyboard. It is indeed nice and quiet. I am taking a star away due to 2 factors. I find that the keyboard does drop letters if you aren't being very firm on your letter presses and I do not like the fact that the mouse wheel has zero \"click\" on the scroll wheel. The scroll wheel is entirely smooth in both the action and the feel. There is no texture on the wheel to allow your finger any traction and there is no click feel when you scroll to allow for precision."

I wish it were longer and a pinch more flat. I have little lady hands yet I still feel like my hand are all hunched up or something.\n\nAlso if you get a USB adapter for your android phone and plug in the Bluetooth adapter but this mouse and keyboard set, it works flawlessly!

This pair comes at a very reasonable price!\n\nI'll begin with the mouse: it is just the right size for me. I have smaller hands but the mouse sits very comfortably and the \"compact\" part of its name suits it well. It is not huge or bulky, and it is very lightweight. The wheel is smooth and sensitive and the clicking has stayed very quiet despite months of use - something I was worried about. It glides on my mousepad nicely and I have never had any lagging issues. It is actually quite responsive.\n\nOnto the keyboard: I particularly like the layout. Everything is very straightforward aside from the fact that you have to use the function key along with the F# keys to change volume, but that is not an issue for me. Keys have also been super quiet since day one despite daily use and I have never had an issue with stickiness or the keys not registering.\n\nConnection on its own has remained perfect, and the battery life is fantastic. Have not had to change batteries since purchasing this set in October. I am very happy with their performance thus far."

As a heavy computer user for work, I wanted to get off my laptop and go back to a keyboard and mouse. I hastily purchased this one, thinking, one keyboard is as good as any, and the price was right. Well NO.\n\nTyping on this feels like typing in playdough. The plastic it's made from has a shiny textured gloss to it, which doesn't help, and yeah, the keypresses is like trying to use a zx spectrum chiclet kb. Lots of missed keypresses. Would not recommend for anything but the most casual of typers.\n\nThe mouse is also very tiny. Not comfortable at all to hold and use constantly for people over 6 yrs old.\n\nThat said, it works, was exactly as described (I should have read better), and my only real complaint here is my own impatience."

A bonus would be the very quiet action of the keys and mouse, making it nearly silent/inaudible when someone is typing on the keyboard - massively appreciate this vs. the old boxy dell keyboards that sound like someone's punching the keys.\n\nTLDR; 3-stars because i hate wireless keyboards (they are junk).

O! the mouse is perfect too, i have smaller hands and cant with the bulky mouses so this one is perfect! will update with pictures later!"

I bought it just for the heck of it, I was looking at ESP32 boards and this came up and I figured why not.\n\nIt actually works really well with the fabGL Arduino library :-) there's a small wiring diagram printed on the board, and it seems to match the wiring schema for PS2 and VGA from fabgl.\n\nI set it up as a generic ESP32 dev board in the Arduino IDE, and try downloading the sample space invaders program, and amazingly it actually worked first try!\n\nSo seems like a pretty cool useful little board, and if the schematic I have from the fabGL git page is right (and it seems right for VGA and PS2 connections at least) then there's a way to get you a few more GPIOs, plus the audio port, and so on.\n\nBy the way, the picture of the board didn't show an audio port or a micro SD port, but the board I got seems to have both, which is a nice bonus :-)"

Amazon.ca or the seller should add the option to select the large harness. But I was able to successfully alter the harness for $20 extra and now it's perfect :)"

        "review": "I really like it. My desktop is quite expensive...and I used to carry it around without this contraption, up and down 2 flights of stairs. Whenever I strap this brace on the PC, I ALWAYS feel anxious because it seems like it's not strong enough to carry 25, or so, pounds. Still, every time I use it, it works just fine and the handle always stays intact!\n\nI don't know if I would travel with this brace outside of my house, though. I could easily see myself walking through a crowd of people, at the airport, and somebody bumping into it and causing something to break or be damaged. After all, the case is totally exposed. Dents and scratches are to be expected, if you're not careful.\nOne thing that I do feel is disappointing, about the strap, are the carrying pockets. They're just not big enough for me to carry valuable items, alongside the PC, and feel comfortable that those items won't fall out - and some have. Luckily, no damage has ever come to a mouse or game controller that fell out.\nThe pockets could easily be made larger and more secure. An average-sized keyboard looks sketchy on the side of the brace because its form-factor is so tall that it will tilt a little bit. It'll probably never fall over, but it's just another concern that I have.\nIt's not worth it to carry important things inside those little pockets unless those things are small enough to be inconveniences (like a usb drive or a mouse pad).\n\nRegardless, the brace does its job VERY well and it enables me to travel with my desktop, more often than I should. As long as you clip it right and strap the velcro properly, your desktop will be safe in your hands."

I was hoping to replace the onboard PS/2 on the motherboard with this card; the DH55HC is equipped with only one PS/2 port, which is a combo port (purple/green). The BIOS on the DH55HC allows me to disable the onboard PS/2 combo port, which i did. But unfortunately, my functionning PS/2 keyboard did not work on this PS/2 Expansion Card. And yes, the SATA power cable was plugged-in the expansion card.\n\nThe adapter did not contain any instruction nor driver; Windows 7 x64 recognized the peripheral but prompted me for a driver. Did not try any other operating system because this card needed to go in this particular offline computer.\n\nThe seller offer an RMA but shipping back the card would cost me $20,00 canadian so the card went into the \"junk\" pile of useless, unstable or barely functionning computer parts."

I would rate the mouse 2 stars as it's VERY small (uncomfortable for most people I guess), it feels cheap ( It weights close to nothing) and I noticed that the left click works about 70% of the time."

        "review": "The keyboard isn't bad at all. The keys have a good feel, some decent resistance before a quick release. This is much better than most inexpensive keyboards. The extra keys mostly work with my Ubuntu 18.04 laptop. A few don't do anything and a few do things other than what they're supposed to do, but they're mostly useful. I imagine they all work correctly on a Windows computer. The keyboard is lightweight but doesn't feel flimsy.\n\nThe mouse precision is good even on my plain white desk at work and the buttons and wheel work fine, but the mouse is barely bigger than a travel mouse and its shape is peculiar. It's almost hourglass-shaped if you look at it from the front, and the small amount of outward curve toward the top has the \"next/previous web page\" buttons right where my thumb sat when I tried to hold on to the mouse. Probably my preteen daughter could have used it better but it was barely usable for me. As mentioned, the buttons have a solid feel to them.\n\nThe instructions don't have much useful information, but this is a keyboard and mouse. I'd hope that the instructions are mostly not needed.\n\nThere are a few minuses aside from the size and shape of the mouse.\n\n- The keys make a squish-release noise which drove me up a wall until I put on my headphones. Probably I'm just being an oversensitive baby, but still.\n\n- The top-right corner of the keyboard has buttons which are supposed to lock the computer and to ask if you want to power down, but on my Linux machine they suspended the computer and turned it off immediately without prompting. This wouldn't be a problem except for their location where they'd get tapped by mistake when I moved the keyboard on my desk.\n\n- The keyboard is lopsided, with the arrow keys and the numeric keypad to the right. This is fine if you're using the keyboard on a desk but not if you put your legs up and use it on your lap. I don't know how many people would want to do this but I'm not sure why you'd have a wireless keyboard and not do it.\n\nOverall I think these are a good value if you aren't bothered by the shortcomings I mentioned."

        "review": "I like the quality of my K628RGB-PRO but there were several issues. First I got the wrong software because the names are similar or they have the wrong software on one of their links. Second when the bluetooth is on the software says there's a firmware update that breaks the keyboard. I had to uninstall software and bluetooth, reset, unplug. Luckily that fixed it. Third the keyboard goes into sleep mode even when plugged in. I turned off all the usb save power options in device manager but didn't stop it. Now I just live with it waking up and beeping like a usb device has connected or disconnected. There's also no ` which I just to key up for discord. And no enter key on number pad and the zero is not long like a normal pad. There's also no easy to use delete key near the backspace to delete from the right. Of course I knew I'd have to adapt to a few difference but those are the worst ones for me. I was able to map the ` to the escape key, the ESC to the - key on the top right and the delete key to the + to the right of the backspace key. It's clicky but that was expected. I wish there was good easy fast on/off button. I guess if using bluetooth when I would need it, I could use the switch under it but it's small. A push button would of been nice. Maybe there's a macro or key combo from windows I can use. I hope this helps everyone. I usually don't spend over $35 for a keyboard this was $65 on sale so maybe $75 cnd with tax. Not bad but dam that first issue was a big one. And the light options are cool. I was going to give it a 3 but with software working it should be a 4. Note get the Redragon_K628RGB-PRO_Setup_V1.6.7_20221.exe version."

        "review": "TLDR: Great price to get a board if you want to switch out the keycaps and switches for some custom ones, which is what I did. The wireless is not usable for online gaming, but connecting it with a wire is totally fine. The layout is impractical.\n\n1. The wireless is not suitable for suitable for gaming, unless you're casually playing a single player game from the couch and REALLY don't care about input lag. (Note: you can plug this keyboard in using the wire and it is completely fine). But even on the 2.4 Ghz with wireless dongle, the keyboard will sometimes stop sending keystrokes for a full second and then just send a bunch of them at the same time in a batch. Some key presses simply get missed. Not playable for any online games. It's actually annoying to type this review with! The wire is not long enough for my standing desk, so I cannot play games with this while standing.\n\n2. The keyboard layout is really bad. I bought this keyboard primarily for the keyboard layout, but after using it, I realized the position of the arrow keys is unnatural, since I expect the arrow keys to be at the far right side of the keyboard. I can't get used to it. And the num pad is too close to my regular keys, so typos happen far too often with the sensitive switches I use. It's just not a practical layout unfortunately."

And while I still miss having dedicated F keys, this keyboard otherwise has been the best one I have ever owned, and costs less than half the price of my previous corsair and Logitech keyboards. I put extra money into pre lubed gateron milky reds, foam and tape mods, and o-rings.. Modded this keyboard is very quiet with a deep clacky sound. It feels fantastic and comparable to keyboards more than double the price. Not metal, but feels sturdy and has a little heft to it so you still get a premium feel (once modded). 100% worth it if you like full size features in a tiny package."

        "review": "After downsizing to a TKL a few years ago there were more than a few times where I missed having the numpad so when I saw the layout on the Redragon Pollux, and the fact that it had standard hot swap sockets, I was sold. The functionality of any missing keys are accessible by holding the function key and pressing the key they've mapped that function to. The placement of these remapped functions is intuitive and easy to remember, but if you need to use the F row keys without taking your other hand off of the mouse then this probably isn't the keyboard for you. They've also conveniently mapped media key functions like volume and pause/play to the Z-M keys. The only thing that's outright missing from a full size keyboard is the second enter key.\n\nIt comes with Redragon branded red linear switches which felt way better than I expected. I liked the switches from my old keyboard so I just swapped them in but the stock switches felt good too. Unlike most Redragon keyboards, this one has north facing standard 5 pin hot swappable sockets which means you can install switches from other switch manufacturers like Cherry, Gateron and Kailh. The RGB LEDs stick up a bit from the PCB so they recommend using switches with the little cutout for the LED on the bottom, but even V2 Zealios (which don't have that cutout) snapped in without a problem.\n\nThe plate mounted stabilizers are pretty loose and will need some level of modification to fully eliminate the rattle. Honestly, I've heard worse from more expensive keyboards but there is definitely a lot of room for improvement. Since the board is hot swappable, you could also install enthusiast grade plate mounted stabilizers if you wanted.\n\nThe keycaps are the standard double shot ABS shine through caps that come with most gaming keyboards. The mapped functions are printed in white on the top of the keys, which isn't the cleanest look, but isn't a deal breaker. If you want to put different keycaps on it then you'll need to find a set that includes the smaller right shift and right modifier keys as well as the small 0 and + for the numpad.\n\nThe RGB backlighting is vibrant and animates smoothly. There are about 20 modes to choose from including the expected ones like the color wave and spinning color wheel. You can cycle through them by holding FN and pressing the right alt key. Holding FN and pressing the arrow keys controls the brightness and speed. Holding FN and pressing the space bar will allow you to cycle through single colors for modes that allow it. Pressing FN and backspace will toggle the backlighting on or off.\n\nThere are tiny red LED indicators for caps lock and num lock on either side of the 2 key on the top row. They're recessed enough that they're visible but don't interfere with the rest of the RGB lighting. I've included a picture with my review so you can see what it looks like. You can lock the windows key by pressing FN+Win and the Win key will light up white (more of a purple tinged white because RGB keyboards struggle with pure white backlighting) to indicate that it is locked.\n\nThere is downloadable software you can get from the website on the box but I never bothered with it because you can do everything except program macros directly from the keyboard itself.\n\nThe only real annoyance I have is that the detachable USB C port is on the left side of the keyboard and the included USB C cable isn't a right angle plug so it sticks out further than I would like. Since it's detachable I can buy a right angle cord if it still bothers me later on.\n\nFor around $60 you're getting a unique layout that actually balances form and function in addition to a path to further customization if you choose to take advantage of it."

The keys are soft and easy to type with, and all the normal keyboard functions are there (when using w/Windows). The mouse looks/feels a bit cheap, but works perfectly fine. I have been using the set for a week now and haven't experienced any issues (no connection issues or lags, battery life ok, etc). My only complaint is that the mouse falls asleep very quickly, and I'm having to train myself to click it to turn it back on (as opposed to simply moving it around). All in all, would buy again 100%."

Almost every other sentence has multiple errors where keys just weren't registered or get sticky. Often the keys go Capital out of nowhere and its not that cap locks is on, I use shift to capitalise and its like it gets stuck so even when I let go, letters still type in cap. It has seriously reduced my wpm because of how many errors it makes, I spend way too much time correcting signal errors when typing. Have been unable to contact seller since.\nThree months of use and two keys have already faded - I know I didn't pay a bunch for it but I expected better quality or for it to at least last longer."

Additionally, it came with a little brush that can clean in between the keys!\nIt's very convenient. The size isn't too small and not too big, so it's just right (for me, personally at least). The color is just as shown, which I love! It's such a pretty pastel color. The keys can be a little loud if you're typing a lot, but I personally like the clicky sound. I will say that it does require two AA batteries (one for the keyboard and the other for the mouse), so make sure you have those!\nI will say that the mouse had a weird little (very little, as shown in the 2nd picture) stain just slightly under the left button. I tried cleaning it off with a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol, but it wouldn't come off. To be honest though, I don't mind it since you can't really see it anyways because of how small it is and since its under the button lol. That was the only little thing I could nitpick at, but otherwise, everything else is just lovely! I definitely recommend."

I had an issue where the mouse wasn’t working aware from the keyboard and when I emailed the company’s help through Amazon, the person on the other end was responsive and helpful. More recently, I misplaced the fob rendering the keyboard and mouse useless. I decided to just ask to see how I could obtain a replacement fob and an hour later, the same person (from months ago) answered my inquiry again is arranging for me to receive a replacement fob in the next couple of days.\nI’ll be purchasing from this company again for my work office in the near future because the keyboard is great! I love the feel of a mechanical typewriter. It’s compatible with my wrist rest, it doesn’t feel fatiguing when typing for hours. And most importantly their customer service is outstanding!"

The keys are sturdy, I can type quickly and never mistype due to the keys.\n\nI love gaming mode - switching 'WASD' movement to the arrow keys, sadly in this day some games do no allow you to rebind controls!\n\nI would have loved a small quick start guide or something though, there are a few different colour settings but I do not know the key combinations and have only found the different settings accidently. Basically it is rainbow and you can't change what colour the keys glow but you can dim or turn it off, that's an easily seen setting, but there is 'breathing' modes, basically you can have the glow solid, or have the keys dim in and out and at varying speeds but as I mentioned I have NO IDEA how to change the 'breathing' modes :( I also found gaming mode by accident but very glad I did!!\n\nThe mouse as far as I know there is no way to change the colour settings, and there are two buttons on the left side that I wish I could change what they did when clicked because I am constantly hitting the rear one by accident, and that acts like the 'back' button in your browser and that has led to a lot of swearing especially as it usually happens after I've tyyped something and go to grab the mouse to submit it - it hits back and my page goes back, losing my work! The extra buttons are great when games allow binding but the buttons are millimeters off from being out of my way.\n\nOverall a happy purchase."

        "review": "The BAKTH LED Keyboard is actually quite a wonderful keyboard. While not being able to say it is a mechanical keyboard it has the feel of one. I was disappointed when I found out that the backlights are only rainbow, I first thought they could fade into different colors like the mouse. And don't bother trying to find a program that can somehow program the backlights, I've looked into that and could not find any programs. So if you're looking for a backlight keyboard that can be programmed I'd suggest Corsair keyboards or Red Dragon keyboards. However if you're fine with just the rainbow color on the keyboard then this is the one for you. The other nice thing about this keyboard is that it has the \"FN\" shortcuts, these shortcuts are most convenient to use without having to touch the mouse so many times, which can be a nuisance.\nHere is a list of what they do:\nFN F1 - Opens an outdated music media player, not worth the time to use.\nFN F2 - Reduces Sound\nFN F3 - Increases Sound\nFN F4 - Mutes Sound totally.\nFN F5 - Stops Video\nFN F6 - Clicks on Search bar to search for whatever you need (not sure why it looks like it rewinds)\nFN F7 - Doesn't Work\nFN F8 - Doesn't Work\nFN F9 - Opens Default Browser\nFN F10 - Opens Default Browser (Yes I didn't make a mistake they both open the browser)\nFN F11 - Locks Keyboard so no one can type anything, unless they know the shortcut (to unlock it just press FN F11 Again)\nFN F12 - Haven't figured it out yet the symbol looks like a calculator or numpad shortcut but when I clicked it, it did nothing.\n\nWhile the mouse is a pleasing gesture for the buyer it really is quite a bad mouse. The mouse has a cpi button (cpi is mouse sensitivity) which ranges from slow medium and fast. The cpi button can be nice depending on the width of your screen (Bigger monitor would require faster cpi, while smaller monitor would require slower cpi, etc.) The forward and backward buttons are extremely sensitive and I've accidentally clicked them multiple times. While the cpi button and the forward-backward side buttons are nice for office work they aren't so much for gaming. The infa-red hole on the bottom that tracks movement to move the arrow is a bit high up allowing harder movement, and not as smooth for the customer. So I wouldn't use the mouse for gaming so as for office work (careful depending on what office work you do).\n\nAll in all I'd say the keyboard is really nice for a simple gamer (or serious gamer). It has the mechanical feeling (at least for me, and most likely you.), the gaming backlights most gamers would use. The simple shortcuts, and the legs on the bottom to stand the keyboard higher up. So if you're looking for a cheap gaming keyboard I'd recommend this one, however I would keep looking for a new mouse because the mouse isn't the best.\n\n`Cheers!"

        "review": "My feedback is based on heavy weekday usage in my home office 8+ hrs daily.\n\n1. Lighting - This is a rainbox lighted keyboard, I like to work without an overhead light near a window. This keyboard gives off a really fun light & it is quite bright. I enjoy that feature of the keyboard, but it's not a vital requirement. Please note that you can not change this keyboard to a single color, so don't expect that feature. The description is clear but sometimes consumers get confused & think that all lighted keyboards are the same.\n2. Key-Spacing - Key spacing is critical for speed while typing. There's nothing worse that continuously hitting the wrong keys or your fingers slipping from the keys. I like the feel of these keys, the slight indention for your fingertips & the larger size of the letters on the keys. I can type just as quick as I normally do with no delays & this keyboard has no issues keeping up and is very responsive\n3. Angle - keyboard has a good rise, I extend the little feet so that it is at an angle and this one is a good one. I can't use a keyboard without this feature as it makes my wrists ache (carpal tunnel), and this keyboard does not disappoint.\n4. Price -- When I purchased this keyboard I thought it was a good buy, when I received it & opened the box it came with a mouse! That was like a bonus as I wasn't expecting it.\n\nIf you are hesitating about buying this keyboard, don't! You'll enjoy it, it makes the work day a little more fun & the light is pretty. What are you waiting for, click the \"add to cart\" button now & try this one out!"

After I got the computer and checked the specs I noticed that the description of the product in the page showed the correct specs. THIS MAKES SHOPPING Very confusing because the user does not truly know what they are getting. I am Not really happy about this. But this is not even the real issue it turns out.\n\nThe REAL ISSUE\nThe computers HARD DRIVE died on me after a few hours of setting it up. After a few hours of using the computer and setting it up I then started getting the Blue screen and Windows was telling me that windows files were corrupted and I then had to restore the computer.\n\nLuckily I know what I am doing and I restored the computer to a factory state. And got the computer running again. THE NEXT DAY I started encountering Blue screens again with a similar error. Windows files got corrupted and started the problem again. Something is SERIOUSLY WRONG with the hard drive you put into this computer.\n\nTo test my theory I then installed windows on a separate external drive. To make sure that the problems I am facing was in fact hard drive related. My Hard drive is performing well so far without any issues.\n\nI contacted the company so far with a promising result that they will send me at least the 1 terabyte SSD with windows installed on it. I will update this review once I get the new drive installed and Tested.\n\nAt a minimum the title of the product should match the specs. But with what hopes to be a good customer service I will give a couple more stars. We will see."

I wanted a backup computer with wireless that I could install on my living room TV system as a monitor-- to have the comcast xfinity streaming app on my Samsung 50\" alexa TV as monitor for the Dell. Everything worked great except the cheap USB wireless, which I could not get t to work, even though It found my Xfinity wireless signal, it could not stream any data. I replaced it with a better USB wireless from Amazon and everything worked great. That is why the 4 star rating."

        "review": "I wanted a new desktop to replace an old, burnt out Desktop Clone with Windows XP I've had since 2003. Yes, it still worked until last year. I didn't want to spend a great deal of money, especially with Windows 10, ad OS I strongly dislike. This package was very appealing: what it contained and the price. I've only had it a couple of days, but so far, so good. Everything in it works as should. Everything arrived as described and promptly. Packaged was well packaged, though, why it isn't marked fragile, I don't know. No assembly instructions were included, but it was very easy to install. I don't know about the quality of keyboard and mouse because I'm using my older one. Very easy to connect to WiFI. No issues have arisen yet. I hope this one lasts half as long as its predecessor. It's fast, too, though I don't know about gaming. It comes pre-installed with licensed Windows 10 Pro, which in comparison only has one feature not in Windows 10 home, so not worth much at all. I did some research online about this model. It's from 2011 and went for $1599.00 at that time with an overall score of 4.25 out of 5 stars in satisfaction. Of course, with full refurbishment here, it has been built up and upgraded. The package comes with a major brand monitor, but you don't know which one until you receive it. I received a Lenovo Thinkpad with mine. Overall, I think it is a good purchase at a great price."

        "review": "This is a renewed HP desktop computer with monitor, a new keyboard, mouse and a usb wifi adapter. All cables were included.\nThe first computer developed a hard drive failure after about a week use. After returning the tower component, Blair Tech send me a second unit but that one had a high squeal whenever I used the audio for music or videos. The third shipment was the charm and since receiving it have experienced no problems to date.\nYou may ask why would I accept a third unit after experiencing problems with the first two? Simply because I like the desktop format which incidentally had no blemishes or scratches and the clarity of the images on the monitor. Also, you can't beat the price. I use his computer for general internet browsing, music listening and light office work. The computer loads quickly at startup and the wifi works flawlessly. Videos play with great clarity.\nThis is where I must compliment Blair for their excellent customer service. Each time I called, they were quick to respond to my problem and in a courteous and efficient manner. I received the replacements within a matter of a few days. They were difficult to reach by direct phone but they allow you to leave your number and they return your call when an agent becomes available.\nWould I buy from Blair Tech in the future? Absolutely yes!"

        "review": "I purchased in February 2020 and has constantly used this computer ever since with no problems. The wifi adapter that comes in the package must be inserted to achieve the wifi connection which is very simple. I have even connected 2 printers and a cricut machine to this PC and still it works great. I design tshirts and other customized items on a regular basis. I am writing this review because Windows have recently launched Windows 11 and I'm currently not able to upgrade using this system but I plan to. I am trying to find out if this PC has TPM chip apparently you needs this for the recent update. However, Windows 10 will be supported until the year 2025.\nAgain wonderful product, however, it is refurbished which means your experience and what each individual customer receive will not always be the same or even as the picture shown. I hope this helps you all."

        "review": "Waste of time and a money. Buyer beware. Just because something is preowned or “refurbished,” it shouldn’t be trash. I purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. Upon opening the computer for set up on the 25th of December, we noticed the font of the screen was scratched (picture attached). Once plugged in and turned on, we noticed the whole screen was/appeared shattered all across it (pictures with swirl white background attached). Obviously it was unusable and not up to bar with the advertisement. And talk about a crappy “gift” to give someone (he’s 11 hence the purchase of a refurbished computer but still, I didn’t know it would be trash). When contacting seller, they did apologize and they did send a “replacement” once we confirmed to them that we had sent back the broken screen and it’s corresponding cord. When we received the “replacement” it was honestly worse than the initial shattered one (picture attached). It was NOT the 19’ inches as advertised - it was 17’ - and yes, I measured diagonally as you do with all electronic screens, tv’s, etc. The replacement monitor was a joke and looked like it was from the 1990’s. After messaging with the seller, I decided to just return it - not worth the hassle - and of course they kept a restocking fee of about $40 bucks, which to me is theft. I didn’t return it because I simply changed my mind. They sent a broken one first, then sent an item not as advertised the second time, which is why I returned it. I will be contacting Amazon directly regarding this as I believe this was theft and false advertisement. So as nice as all these other reviews are on here, beware that you do in fact get what you pay for. It’s cheap sure, but so are their products. Cheap, defective, and broken. And, they still make money. Buy new, save yourself the grief of having to purchase, return, and lose money on junk."

For a refurbished computer I’m really impressed how they shipped the product. The boxes were secured inside a larger box and the computer came to me as though it was a brand new computer.

It comes with a small usb wifi dongle thing in the same box as the mouse so don't throw that out! The dongle seems to be pretty weak so I wouldn't use this too far from the source. Speaking of the mouse, mine came absolutely smashed. Why a 5 star review then? Must've been during transit.

Everything works well; quiet, yet affirmative keying; bright green CAPS LOCK LED, which is necessary for awkward 'typers' (like moi) who don't look at the screen as they type away -- only to discover a whole paragraph is in CAPITAL letters, except of course, the first letter of every sentence, which is lowercase.\n\nRegular AAA and AA batts required which for me is better than having a permanent, chargeable battery. I have plenty of old METAL HYDRIDE, and a few rechargeable lithium batts. Although fixed, permanent keyboard batts ought to last a long time, batteries are batteries and if it screws up, the whole keyboard needs replacement. (suppose someone handy with the tech could replace the batt. But I like the removeable battery type devices. Of course some things with permanent batts are okay. Not for keyboards or mice for me. The keyboard is shorter than my standard types, but everything you need is represented.\n\nRecommend for sure!\n\nUpdate: I almost threw away the box which had another component of the keyboard package: A beautiful keyboard protector cover which can be permanently stuck on to the face of the keyboard. Careful you don't throw it out. It is translucent and of a very special plastic material."

I love that it is battery powered and the ease of learning how to use the keyboard. I couldn't figure the other one out (function keys). I have to lock my PC for work and previously used the windows icon+L and this keyboard has a special lock button so I don't have to use two hands to lock my keyboard. I'm so happy that I purchased.

        "review": "I bought this because I recently replaced my PC tower with a laptop, but I didn't want to get rid of my tower and want a simple case to store it in the meantime. If you need this for regular travel, I would recommend spending a little more and getting something sturdier.\n\nTo be one-size-fits-most, this case is a little bigger than my tower (which is 17.5\"L x 18\"H x 7\"W). This case leaves a lot of extra space around my PC.\n\nThat wouldn't be an issue, except for the hard plastic feet on the bottom. My tower does not balance perfectly on all of them or between them; instead, it sits on one set on one side, putting my tower off-balance, even when packed with foam around the sides. The thin, flimsy base insert it comes with isn't sturdy enough to distribute the weight of my tower over the feet; it just bends.\n\nAs a result, when my tower is stored in this case, it tilts to one side and falls over. This is exacerbated when I have accessories in the front pouch, the weight of which pulls the case and tower down to one side (ironically, the large accessory pocket to accommodate my keyboard and cords all with my PC was a major selling point for me). I've tried shifting the tower so it leans the opposite direction to counter-balance, but that is not effective and the tower just falls in that direction. I have to lean it against a wall when it's being stored.\n\nI'm going to get a thicker piece of wood or particle board to cut to size and use as a base. This will distribute the weight of the tower over all four of the plastic feet and solve the balance issue. But I really shouldn't have to do that. It should come with a base sturdy enough to support the weight of a computer tower."

        "review": "UPDATE - I still love this keyboard. But today I noticed that the symbols on two keys (brackets and braces) were printed upside down. When you switch them to be right side up they look ridiculous. I use brackets for encryption a lot. I'll either swap them out or try not to look at the keys too close. If you're a perfectionist it's really annoying. See picture 3 after I turned them the correct way.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not a gamer. A little nerdy though. I do digital forensics so I'm always on the computer. I don't always like turning on the overhead office light since it's super bright but I couldn't see my crappy dell keyboard. Floor lamps can't be conveniently placed and a desk lamp gets in the way of my mega monitor.\n\nEnter this keyboard. I tried and rejected many. I HATE loud keyboards. The red silent switches are an absolute dream. I didn't think silent and mechanical could go together so beautifully.\n\nI took one photo of it straight from the box and one after switching out the caps with tiny print to pudding key caps. Switching the caps was pretty easy though these keys are a little close so be careful.\n\nThe good:\n-Not blindingly bright which is my preference.\n-Silent but tactile. Ah it's so beautiful to my ears.\n-The texture of the keys is like a gaming console. It may wear badly over time but for now it's satisfying.\n-The cord is a decent length.\n-I didn't have to download software. It worked out of the box and you can change colors easily.\n\nThe less good but not deal breakers:\n-The board is angled really high even with the feet down. A wrist rest is a must otherwise you'll be in serious pain.\n-Ultra fine print characters on some keys combined with the dim lights on highest setting would be frustrating. I'm not middle aged and my eye sight is 20/15.\n-The key profile is a little high too. I'll get used to it but if this is your first mechanical it's surprising and will slow your typing speed.\n\nOverall I'm satisfied and it exceeded my expectations. I'm so happy I went with this as opposed to $200.00+ keyboards I was looking at. I like this even more.\n\nI hope it holds up over time. I'll be absolutely gutted if it gets glitchy or breaks."

It’s got the clicky sound I like to hear when typing for work, and I type all day. I love the color effect too, it’s fun to watch and makes my desk less boring.\n\nI don’t use this for gaming at all, but it’s a very high quality keyboard. I type for the majority of my work day and this keyboard always keeps up. It’s the perfect size for me, keys are a great height, and it’s customizable. My long nails don’t even bother the keys, it’s wonderful. Would recommend this brand to anyone in the market for a quality keyboard!"

The tactile feel of the key press is crisp (not spongy like cheap keyboards)\n\nThe software allows you to set the color of the keys however you want and the default programs of the key colors are pretty cool(like the key lights can radiate out from the key you press).\n\nIt’s a standard design size and layout wise (I wish the volume controls were easier to press with one hand for example (instead of fn+f2/f3))."

Accordingly, this keyboard/mouse setup is decent. It's not going to blow you away like a $80+ combo would, but it works and it does a pretty good job.\n\nThe connection is pretty simple, really once the batteries were in, the plug was in and the units were turned on, they worked instantly, no drivers necessary.\n\nThe mouse is a tad flat/small so it's not ideal for working long hours. I do have a nice gaming wireless mouse that $200 that I use given I'm so used to the DPI settings, but the other mouse is okay, really depends on your mouse preferences.\n\nOverall, great value for the price and it gets the job done. Based off the photos you can probably tell if it fits your ergonomic or comfort needs, but the functionality is definitely there.\n\nRecommended."

I first thought it was low batteries, but changed them with fresh new ones and same thing! I will be looking for it's replacement directly after this review. Also, for Mac users, the keyboard feels good and all but I quickly noticed the CMD key is switched with the ALT key, and there is no CMD key to the right of the space bar. Little detail but for me it is quite the nuisance to be aware of!\n\nI just received my new keyboard and mouse and so far so good. The keyboard feels similar to my MBP 2015 that I'm used to, but it's been years since I've used a mouse... so it will take a little getting used to. One thing I notice is the tiny bit of lag when I first move the mouse, but other than that it's fine. The plastic feels not as expensive, or quality, as the Apple products I've used in the past, but it still has a nice texture to it... and it's not like I'm planning on throwing it against the wall any time soon!

Additionally, it came with a little brush that can clean in between the keys!\nIt's very convenient. The size isn't too small and not too big, so it's just right (for me, personally at least). The color is just as shown, which I love! It's such a pretty pastel color. The keys can be a little loud if you're typing a lot, but I personally like the clicky sound. I will say that it does require two AA batteries (one for the keyboard and the other for the mouse), so make sure you have those!\nI will say that the mouse had a weird little (very little, as shown in the 2nd picture) stain just slightly under the left button. I tried cleaning it off with a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol, but it wouldn't come off. To be honest though, I don't mind it since you can't really see it anyways because of how small it is and since its under the button lol. That was the only little thing I could nitpick at, but otherwise, everything else is just lovely! I definitely recommend."

I had an issue where the mouse wasn’t working aware from the keyboard and when I emailed the company’s help through Amazon, the person on the other end was responsive and helpful. More recently, I misplaced the fob rendering the keyboard and mouse useless. I decided to just ask to see how I could obtain a replacement fob and an hour later, the same person (from months ago) answered my inquiry again is arranging for me to receive a replacement fob in the next couple of days.\nI’ll be purchasing from this company again for my work office in the near future because the keyboard is great! I love the feel of a mechanical typewriter. It’s compatible with my wrist rest, it doesn’t feel fatiguing when typing for hours. And most importantly their customer service is outstanding!"

        "review": "Upping my 3 star review to 4 after living with this for a couple more weeks. Granted, this is subjective, but here are my comments that might sway you if this kinda stuff bugs you:\n\n1. Key feel. This is totally subjective, but the mechanical keys on this model have absolutely no extra initial resistance - the pressure needed to depress them is constant through the key press. My other keyboards (mechanical and scissor-type) have that first extra little bit of resistance you need to overcome to get the key down. I have a light touch when keyboards and kinda rely on feeling that initial 'give' of the keyboard to know I've actually engaged the key (and also that I HAVEN'T, in the cases where I accidentally bump an adjacent one). My original review harped on this a bit, and lead to the original 3 stars. Over the last couple of weeks I've gotten more used to the feel of this keyboard though. It isn't anywhere as annoying as I first thought, and I'll probably get completely used to this over time. And given the build quality of the keyboard, I'll likely have it for a long time, so there is that!\n\n2. I should have noticed this in the product image, or maybe I did but it never clicked (see what I did there?)... The dual-use keys (i.e. numbers, special characters) on most keyboards have the main use indicated large and in the middle (i.e. the \"1\" key's \"1\") and the smaller shift character above (i.e. the \"1\" key's \"!\"). On this one they are the same size and beside each other. Again, not a problem for touch typers who have memorized every special character on the qwerty keyboard. Maybe I'll get used to it, but the special characters are harder to read as they are beside the main ones. Check the product image and decide for yourself.\n\n3. I like a bit more angle on the keyboard than this one gives, even with the legs raised.\n\nOther than the above old-man rants, the keyboard is very solid. It looks like it'll last for years, and the extra function buttons will come in handy. Macro buttons, volume control, and fully customizable key lighting (down to the individual key, when you use their utility program to config the keyboard). It'll probably last long enough that I'll get used to the key feel. Probably last long enough that I'll get used to the key stencils. Probably outlast my old man butt."

But ,the lighting malfunctioned after a couple of hours use . So back it went. A bit disappointing. This could be a one off but it left me hesitant about buying it again and I purchased something else and bought quiet switches to replace the standard ones. I know , a bit more money but everything is works fine.\n\nEdit: I was contacted by the company and was pleasantly surprised by the lengths they went to in regards to making this right and my satisfaction. This does not happen often . I have a replacement keyboard that has no issues, which means I have no issues. Well done on the customer service."

        "review": "I use this work work as I wanted a low profile Mechanical keyboard at a price my wife won’t divorce me over. I never thought I’d buy redragon as I have always had Logitech /Corsair keyboards which all worked fine for many years, but wanted something different. I have a Corsair k70 Low profile rapid fire speed to game on for comparison and have wanted the g815 for a year or so, price made that keyboard less a viable option.\n\nPros:\n- price compared to g815 and k70 low profile.\n-fair quality (metal frame is solid enough)\n- rgb adjustability (neat modes and decent preselected Colors) adds some flair.\n- tested for gaming and honestly surprised me, I would totally start my son on this keyboard for gaming, as the key presses work very nicely together. Very light to depress and actuate.\n-media buttons work fine, the rubber feeling isn’t that terrible at all. The volume rocker works fine but is very rigid, not as smooth as k70 or a Logitech. But you get one, so +.\n-possibly hotswappable keys, which could make things interesting, I’m the future for variety or improved key caps.\n\nCons:\n-fair quality (key caps and depress doesn’t feel as solid as k70) but not bad either and office typing has a nice feeling when typing.\n- RGB could be a bit brighter, it is on the subtle side similar to g815. K70 lighting is far brighter and more customizable but would look more “gaming” and not office-esk.\n\nTLDR\nPleasantly surprised, still not high end quality (3.5 on 5)but in price category for low profile, with numpad and media buttons it’s worth a serious look. I would purchase again."

But the F2 key backlight is sucked at pink no matter the RGB profile.\n\n[Update]\nThe support team from Redragon has contactd me and I was inform this is by design. The F1-4 will light up if M1-4 key are programmed. To get rid of the F1-4 key light up, press and hold FN+ESC for 3s.\nThe support team are very kind and have fast response.

Boy am I glad that I picked this up. For half the price of other brands and comparable models, this keyboard works like a dream. The RGB options are endless, the switches are nice and light for those who type alot and the responsiveness in game is unparralled.\n\nA couple of opportunities for improvement:\n1. How the heck do we program these G buttons?!\n2. Why does every model need its own red dragon app? I had to download two different ones before I found the right one for my model."

Use the manual to set the macros with keyboard shortcuts since it wont work via software. Once you set them you cant expect them to always work eityer though after a few hours the macros are seemingly empty again and pressing them does nothing. Besides that they are membrane and feel REALLY bad to press and sometimes when set dont even activate.\nOther than the giant maceo thing the keyboard is nice."

I have been using the set for a week now and haven't experienced any issues (no connection issues or lags, battery life ok, etc).

I decided to just ask to see how I could obtain a replacement fob and an hour later, the same person (from months ago) answered my inquiry again is arranging for me to receive a replacement fob in the next couple of days.\nI’ll be purchasing from this company again for my work office in the near future because the keyboard is great! I love the feel of a mechanical typewriter. It’s compatible with my wrist rest, it doesn’t feel fatiguing when typing for hours. And most importantly their customer service is outstanding!"

        "review": "a decent upgrade over my laptop and computer monitor speakers. The sound doesn't exactly scream high quality and do sound \"tinny\" but apparently this is normal for new speakers as they have to \"broken-in\". The bass is very limited, you get to hear some bass, but don't expect to be blown away. The rgb lights do liven things up and look great. The cables connecting the speakers together are short, about 3 feet in length, and cannot be swapped out, but it's USB so you could use a USB extension cord. You can connect to other devices using the 3.5mm audio jack which is hard wired to the speaker itself, so you cannot change the cable if it happens to stop working. It has bluetooth connection as well but I have yet to try it.\n\nWould I recommend this? for the price range yes, and if its on sale, then definitely. However, if you want amazing sound quality and don't mind spending more, than I would suggest doing so to avoid disappointment. For me, just a decent upgrade to what I had before without spending over $100, the Redragon GS812 Andante speakers are fine.\n\nupdate after roughly 8 months of use: left speaker cuts out, and has lower volume than right speaker, crappy usb cable that cannot be replaced since the other end is hard wired to left speaker, have fun twisting and turning the cable to try to get the sound on the left speaker to act normal again, shoddy product avoid!"

        "review": "These speakers are good if you have a lap top and you want to improve the sound. The quality is better than built in lap top speakers. They sound like normal desktop computer speakers and they don't have as much bass as you would expect.\n\nThere is a design flaw that limits the use of these speakers. I have two 32 inch monitors. The speakers are taller than the bass of the monitor. The left and right speaker are permanently attached by a thin speaker cable. There is no way to remove this cable and there is no input jacks for speaker wire. This means you can't buy a longer cable. The main flaw is that this cable is not long enough. If you have a laptop then this will not be an issue. But if you have two monitors then there is no way to put these speakers on each side of the monitors. I had to lay the speakers on their side in order to use them. I could not stand them up.\n\nAnother design flaw became apparent as soon as I did this. The volume and bass knobs are located on the side of one of the the speakers. The decorative lights are located within the speaker and they shine out. When the speaker with the volume knob is placed on its side you can't see the decorative lights on the speaker. It is hidden from view. For the price these speakers don't sound as good as I expected them to sound. Maybe the reason for this is due to a short cable that prevents me from standing these things up.\n\nThis also makes the buttons and knobs harder to access as I had to place these speakers behind the monitors. I am using the 3.5 jack and plugging them in the back of my computer. There are no issues with that. They loose two stars because of these flaws. To be fair, you should not have this problem if you are using one monitor."

I may have just gotten a faulty unit but it's at least comforting to know that support is here to help and if things don't work out they will do their best to make things right. All my other Redragon products over the years work really well so I still have confidence in the brand even though I had one bad experience."

When I booted it up the first time there was a really loud whirring for a few seconds, but as I don't do a lot of processing it hasn't come on since then. As the output jacks are VGA you will need to buy a VGA to HTML adapter for each HTML monitors. It came with a USB plug-in wireless receiver that allows you to access the internet.

I later had a question about adding memory (it is, after all, a server, not really a PC), and they sent me a document that led me through the process. 'Couldn't have asked for more!\n\nThe computer itself is top quality, sturdy and solid. HP offers a system performance adviser as a free download, and I highly recommend it if you want to keep track of what's going on inside the box; it provides a wealth of useful information.\n\nOne thing worth noting: It is a rather old machine, and it has a proprietary power supply. Exercising an abundance of caution, I picked up a refurbished spare, just in case something goes wrong. Of course, now that I have the spare, nothing will ever go wrong with the original. Oh, well.\n\nAgain, quick delivery, solid machine, unsurpassed customer service, great support (and did I mention a great price?). Five stars, and then some."

Set up was easy (I love HDMI cables), deleted McAfee and installed Norton, connected to HP, updated drivers and Windows 10 OS. The Windows 10 Home update took a couple hours but was fine and finished correctly. Love it and my wife loves it, the monitor is the perfect size for her. We are very happy with the system and the price."

Long story short after illness and recovery from a big fall...today, I asked my daughter, who is in from out of town, to help me get it up and running. It would turn on, but the programming to set it up did not start. It is just a black screen. The return window is over and so is the support, but in the fine print, it says it has a limited 1 year warranty. I guess it does not. I am out $500 with no way to get it back. Faulty product....limited warranty was a joke. I am 71 and with challenges when it comes to technology and limited income. I don't know who to talk to, but I am very upset. $500 is a huge deal to me and I feel defeated. If any one has any suggestions, I am open to them. Respectfully, Janie"

        "review": " Disclaimer: The Epomaker EK68 was sent to me for review. Of course, I will aim to be as objective and fair in the review. I also already own my custom Keychron Q1 which I am happy with so I'm reviewing this out of interest and to help other people thinking of picking it up. Take for that what you will.\n\nI'll put the conclusion up here if you don't want to read through the whole review since it's quite detailed. Hope it helps!\n------\nConclusion: Is this a perfect keyboard? Of course not. Parts of it feel a cheap for sure. Anyone can nitpick and criticize for days. But when I think about how much keyboards cost nowadays, it makes me realize that this is really a very good deal. For $130 CAD I get about 70% of my Q1 that cost me $300. Plus it can even be wireless! While I still prefer my Q1, I don't really miss it that much while using this, unlike some other keyboards I've tried where I instantly want to go back. This is especially true with all those gaming keyboards from big brands that easily run $200+ yet feel just awful to type on. Now, alternatively you could build your own custom keyboard to beat this but honestly, I highly doubt you can do it for $130. Basic switches and clone caps alone will set you back like $50-70. And with the custom hobby, you often have to wait months to get your kit in AND have to pay a ton in shipping and customs. This is on Amazon so everything is priced in and has modding options if you want to try. So yes, 5 stars for its value. 4.5 \"real\" stars because nothing is perfect. If you're someone who's just looking to get into mechanical keyboards, I think this is a very solid starter set. And who knows, the Epomaker EK68 might be enough to scratch that itch and you won't have to look back at this hobby.\n------\nWhat You Get: The keyboard itself (see below). A wireless dongle that can be stored on the keyboard itself. A generic braided long USB-C cable. A decent keycap/switch puller combo. A few spare switches. A few extra keycaps in different colors. I ordered Gateron Yellows but was sent Epomaker's Budgerigar's switches. More on that later.\n\nBuild Quality: It's plastic. All of it. That's not to say it's good or bad necessarily, I do think it's quite well built and feels sturdy. It's just a little lighter than I expected, especially since the Q1 is made fully out of metal and weighs like 5x more. It's still weighty enough to sit firmly on your desk.\nIt has kick-flip feet to give it a total of 3 typing angles. Note that if you want to do deep mods beyond keycaps and switch swaps, I don't think it'll be very easy. I don't see any outside screws anywhere.\n\nRGB: The RGB is kinda muted. There's a thick white polycarbonate plate between the PCB and keycaps. The keycaps themselves aren't transparent in any way. Thus, the RGB from the switches is somewhat blocked. You can definitely see it no problem but it won't be a crazy light-show unless you're in the dark. Epomaker does give a ton of RGB effects options and should suit the majority of people unless you're super duper specific about the effects you want.\n\nWireless/Bluetooth: No problems with the wireless for me. You'll have to read the manual to know the instructions on how to pair via Bluetooth but using the wireless dongle was plug-and-play. Unfortunately, there's no battery-level indicator. With RGB on, I get about 2 days of use without needing to charge. RGB is extremely draining on the battery so it's not too bad IMO. My wireless gaming mouse has a similar thing where RGB on only gets it a day of life but a week without. As such, you can think of 2 days as a worst-case scenario and you should be able to get much, much longer with RGB off. I didn't test it in time for this review however. The EK68 does go into a sleep mode to try and conserve battery every now and then but it didn't give me any issues waking up. Just type. Think of this as a wired keyboard with wireless when you need it in a pinch instead of a truly wireless keyboard. I didn't have any latency issues whatsoever.\n\nKnob: By default, the knob is volume up and down, but you can press it for mute/unmute as well. The knob feel is alright. You can feel each \"click\" for every step which I like but it doesn't feel as good as my Q1 it's a little mushier in comparison.\n\nSwitches: Like I said, I was sent the tactile Budgerigar switches. They're not too bad honestly. Factory lube could be better. I prefer Gateron Yellows since I like linear but these have been pretty decent to type on. And I got my highest ever typing test speed at 131 wpm with these the first time I used it. Coincidence? Probably. But it goes to show that it definitely wasn't slowing me down. The actuation point is a little weighty and is right at the start. Thus, it feels a little bit like a linear since you get past it right away instead of getting halfway before hitting it. It makes me feel kinda confident when I type, like when I press a key it's because I intend to; you won't be accidentally pressing keys with these. I've done a lot of typing and gaming on these and it performed just fine. I like these much better than Cherry and Gateron Browns or whatever other switches you find in generic gaming keyboards at Best Buy.\n\nTyping Feel: I'm not totally sure what the gasket does but it does feel reasonably soft to type on, like I'm not bottoming out hard. I'm using it for like 14 hour days doing work or playing games and I haven't gotten fatigued at all. Unlike my Q1 though, it doesn't flex much at all. That polycarbonate plate is quite thick which contributes to the rigidity I suppose. The feel of each switch is fairly uniform, though the larger switches like the backspace does feel a bit different. My Q1 is softer and nicer to type on but not by that much.\n\nTyping Sound: It's not a clicky keyboard so it's not super loud. It sounds a quite muted if anything, probably because of the full-plastic build and polycarbonate backplate. Don't get this if you want to flex your cool mechanical keyboard noises to your gamer friends over Discord. Out of the box, I think it sounds quite good for stock. It's a mix between clack and thoccy, leaning more on thoccy given its muted nature. I find it pleasant to listen to when doing focused typing in an office. You can see the video for how it sounds. I took it with my phone camera so it isn't the BEST audio quality but gives a general feel for it. Wear headphones to hear some of the bass."

Easy to scratch if you use a metal Pry tool. Stabs didn’t have a lot of lube on them, but sound better then my gaming keyboard. Love it for typing then linears, don’t accidentally press anything. Spacebar has Akko lavender purple pro. First mechanical keyboard, happy with my purchase! The switch puller is easy to bend a bit.

        "review": "The Akko 3068B is a 65% keyboard kit. I got the Black & Pink version of the board with Akko CS Jelly Pink switches. I primarily used the 3068B with a PC running Windows 10, but I also confirmed that it works over Bluetooth with my Pixel 3 running Android 12.\n\nThe Akko 3068B shipped in a black cardboard box with a pink and black slipcover. The 3068B is pictured on the front of the slipcover, in addition to text specifying the chosen keycap profile and color scheme. There is also a sticker that denotes the hot-swappable nature of the 3068B's printed circuit board (PCB). The Akko logo and Akko's social media links and corporate contact information are provided on the sides of the slipcover. A sticker denoting the selected switch type is also found on the top side of the slipcover. Finally, a diagram of the 3068B identifying the board's shortcut keys is featured on the back of the slipcover.\n\nInside the box, the keyboard is stored in a polyethylene bag, which is seated inside a foam cutout. The top of the board is covered by a clear plastic cover. Besides the board itself, the package included a user manual, keycap puller, a USB-C to USB-A cable, and a variety of novelty keycaps. The 3068B also includes a selection of additional modifier keycaps in alternative colors and sizes for use with other keyboards. This is a nice touch.\n\nThe Akko 3068B has a plastic case with a thick bezel and rounded corners. The case is very heavy for a plastic board. The keyboard has a recessed USB-C port on the left side of the board. The bottom of the board has collapsible plastic feet with rubber caps.\n\nOn the opposite side of the back of the Akko 3068B from the USB-C port is a toggle switch for the keyboard's wireless functionality. This switch was not aligned correctly on my unit and required more force and finagling than should be necessary to switch on or off. It also did not lock fully into the \"On\" position, though the wireless functionality worked perfectly in both the Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz modes. I used the 3068B at my desk 1–1.5 meters from my computer, so I do not have a real sense of the limits of the wireless range. The keyboard does go into a power-saving sleep mode when using the 2.4 GHz or Bluetooth modes and requires a second or two after an initial input to wake up and begin registering keystrokes.\n\nThe layout is slightly more horizontally compressed than feels natural to me. I sometimes had an issue reaching for the \"Backspace\" key and hitting the \"Tilda\" key instead. I also do not understand why 65% keyboards typically opt to include \"Page Up\" and \"Page Down\" as two of the default options in the rightmost column of keys. Thankfully, this can be rebound in the Akko Cloud software. However, I greatly appreciate having dedicated arrow keys.\n\nThe keycaps are Doubleshot PBT in Akko's ASA profile. ASA uses roughly the same height as OEM keycaps but with spherical tops. I like this profile a lot, but I think I narrowly prefer Epomaker's slightly lower-profile GSA profile. The outlines of letters and symbols are very sharp, and the keycaps feel both smooth to the touch and robust in terms of build quality.\n\nThere are three indicator LEDs on the right bezel. The topmost light identifies the status of CAPS LOCK, and the bottommost light identifies whether the Windows key is locked, but I could not discover what purpose the middle light serves. As with the Akko 3061 I previously reviewed, the RGB lighting, while consistent, is not as bright as on other boards in its price range. These include those from MarvoDIY or even the various SK/GK rebrands I have used. The LEDs are north-facing.\n\nWith the Akko CS Jelly Pinks, the Akko 3068B has a deep, thoccy sound profile. The board sounds excellent out of the box, with just a hint of hollowness. That said, it is definitely on the louder side. The 3068B has the best stock stabilizers I have used on any budget board. There is little to no rattle on any of the stabilizers. I did not find it necessary to perform any mods on them, which is a first for any of the review units I've received.\n\nThe 3068B uses Akko's Cloud software for key rebindings, macros, and LED lighting customization. I did not use this software during my review period, as I was satisfied with the stock shortcuts. Akko has done a good job of picking stock shortcut keybindings that make intuitive sense on both of the boards I have reviewed from them. It is worth noting that the Escape, Windows, Right Alt, and Function Keys cannot be rebound under any circumstances, and some of the default function shortcuts cannot be remapped. These non-remappable shortcuts primarily control the backlight and wireless functionality of the keyboard. On the other hand, media controls and other miscellaneous shortcuts can be rebound. Also worth noting is that the wireless functionality switch on the back of the keyboard must be switched off to upgrade the keyboard's firmware.\n\nOverall, I like the Akko 3068B a lot and feel very comfortable recommending it as a starter 65% keyboard."

Soy una mera intermediaria pero os puedo asegurar que él tiene muy buena opinión del teclado y le parece que hemos hecho una muy buena compra, comparando con los teclados que ha utilizado de sus amigos."

        "review": "I have only a week with it and I like it a lot. My last keyboard (G413 SE) was my first mechanical keyboard experience but with time I started to feel that it was really bad device for its price.\n\nI wanted something \"hotswapable\" and wireless until I came across this keyboard. I think for a first experience into a mechanical keyboard it is a really good experience. They sound exactly as I watched in dozens of reviews.\n\nSoftware for these board is as good as the keyboard. I found it pretty rough and uncomfortable to use. You need to save color profiles and rebound key profile separately. Sometimes it does not save or program crashes from time to time.\n\nFlamingo switches are my cup of tee so I am happy with my choice and keycaps are really nice for the price. Really easy to type in. Due to the steel plate there is almost zero flex, so I guess gaskets are only for sound purposes. A shame because there are other brands that have same board reference that includes the PC plate.\n\nBuild quality is solid with some minor issues, like around the space bar, where the case warps a bit. Nothing noticeable but if one looks carefully can be spotted easily. There are also some keycaps, specially the yellow one that have some problem with legends but I am nickpicking. Again, for the price the quality is really good.\n\nOverall, I liked the sound, build and typing experience out of the box; for the price it is a solid choice if you do not think to mod the keyboard for a while."

        "review": "i was really excited about this keyboard when i ordered it, and its been a few months since buying and using. first, there are only 2 modes of the led which im pretty sure the pictures said it had more modes, one mode for just the led to stay on and the other for it to blink. secondly, the brightness doesnt even work. if i want it brighter, no response. if i want it dimmer, also no response. this kinda annoys me as sometimes i like my room dim and i want my desk area to match the vibe. also the numbers/letters are kind of faded so whenever theres a bright light (because im doing homework or something) i cant see the number or letter well. also, the flaps behind the keyboard are really small, so if you dont like having your keyboard flat down on the table, you may not want to purchase this keyboard as it doesnt really do a thing and i have to use my arm rest cushion to hold it up more. i also love to play games a lot, and the left shift of my keyboard cant click well along with some other keys. what i mean by this is that you have to press really hard on the key for it to be able to “activate.” whenever im playing games, i mostly use my pinky to press on the shift button as i have my other fingers on wasd and the space bar. i was also really excited about the mouse, but it looks nothing like the picture. the body part just looked like lighting ( sounds cool but it really isnt, cant provide a pic rn ) or just random lines squiggled. the left and right click part of the mouse also looked nothing like the picture? as i was just lines going down each side. the bottom of the mouse also has no good padding, so it’s very sensitive to a small move. luckily, i was able to turn it down so the sensitivity was how i liked it.\noverall, im not happy or disappointed about this set, i just wish it was a little bit better. if you are someone who are big on appearance and the way it works, i wouldnt recommend this keyboard. if you just want an led keyboard with an led mouse then you should have no problem."

        "review": "Ever since I learned about low-profile switches I have been trying to find a keyboard that fits all the things I wanted. There aren't a ton of options out there, but this one hit most of them so I purchased.\n\nI typically have 60% keyboards but could not find one that was at the pricepoint I wanted. I liked the NuPhy Air60 but the price with shipping to Canada was almost 200$. I was nervous this keyboard would be bigger than I like, but happy to report that is it still extremely compact and actually about the same size as my existing AJAZZ K620T.\n\nI originally wanted the Brown switches but I could only choose between Red and Blue at time of purchase. I went with Reds as I wanted it to be as quiet as possible for work. I watched some videos about what these low-profile Gaterons sounded like and from the videos I thought they would be louder, but it is actually extremely quiet and perfect for work. The videos must have put the mic right up to the keyboard. In an office the keys are barely audible. They are linear switches so no clicking, but there is a bit of gradient in the key pressure. I have had some Red's in the past with heavier caps that were a bit too smooth for me, these actually have a very nice key pressure and obviously short travel. There is some resistance and it feels nice.\n\nI can definitely appreciate the updates with the V2 version of this keyboard. I definitely needed to use the legs for incline, very comfortable angle for me. I appreciate the keycaps, they feel nice and solid. I saw reviews from the V1 that said the keycaps feel cheap, these ones feel solid and durable. The shape could maybe be evolved as the rounded key edges sometimes caused me to make typing errors, but they could just be me getting used to new caps. I also appreciate the frame reinforcement, the build feels very solid but also very light. I could imagine it would feel pretty hollow and flimsy.\n\nOverall I am very happy with my purchase and getting used to the switches and caps quickly. I don't really have any negative feedback yet but will update if things change."

        "review": "Bought this back in early 2022, since then, I've gone through a replacement battery (the seller does provide a warranty FYI), and a few back-n-forth with their tech support through Amazon regarding the Bluetooth stability issue.\n\nThe keyboard works great when the rows lit up at least 4 rows (press Fn+B to check battery), anything below that, there's a consistent annoying loss of Bluetooth connection. This happens no matter if you're on Mac or Windows..\n\nThe BIG issue is that once the keyboard loses connection, while the \"1\" key flashes and the keyboard tries to reconnect, the computer thinks you're holding the key down. It's really annoying at work where you may accidentally delete/send/WHATEVER not intentionally. This issue is still there, been there for almost 2 years..\n\nWould I still buy a Keychron keyboard? Yes, because I travel a lot for work, and this lightweight compact keyboard meets my need.\nWould I recommend it to my friends? Yes, but only plugged in.\nI wish the K3 version 3 could resolve the Bluetooth issue, at least Keychron is aware of it."

This one hits both, plus has the added bonus of being mechanical PLUS the keys are hot-swappable. The brown switches are perfect for me - not too loud when I’m typing away e-mails, but still satisfyingly tactile - and so far when I’ve been gaming, it’s also worked really well.\n\nAs for the backlight - it’s not bothersome to me, and if it is, I just turn it off. I don’t believe the one I got does RHB - but I really didn’t care about a backlight when I got this.\n\nI was a bit nervous not having the number pad, but I haven’t missed it so far, and I’ve been using it for nearly a week.\n\nI definitely recommend this keyboard (and brown switches) if you’re someone who wants to take the jump to a mechanical keyboard, but doesn’t want it to be too loud, and is looking for a lower profile style keyboard."

Let’s start with the UPS the MOUSE PAD is larger than most and I like it like that, the design is very nice colour is nice, a few lose stitches on the sides but that’s fine. The MOUSE, I love this mouse it’s my favourite thing about this set! It’s beautiful moves nicely, changes colours, you can change your DPI it’s way easier to use my knife in games now with the side buttons too, so this mouse is a go go GO for gaming! Now the KEYBOARD.... ahh well it worked really really well for a week or two and than buttons got really sticky and gave out some how, I never eat near it I’ve never spilt anything on it, I never slammed on it, just after a few uses of it, it gave out like my space bar I have press multiple times for it to work as with my 3 key and 5 letter keys. Now what’s cool about it though is that if you press FN and INS at the same time you can change the colour patterns and it makes the clicking noise, but in all I wouldn’t buy this ever again WASTE OF MONEY, I am going to now buy a new keyboard and hope for the best! Also it’s made out of this plastic no metal at all it looks kinda cheap but it feels nice. anyways DONT BUY UNLESS YOU JUSY WANT THE MOUSE AND THE MOUSE PAD THE KEYBOARD SUCKS!!!"

The mouse is a great shape because this is one of the few mouses that don’t make my pinkie hurt. I actually take this mouse to work lol. The only negative thing I have to say is that this keyboard is VERY LOUD, like I barely want to type on it especially at night time. I’ve had some loud keyboards, but this one is bonkers lol. It doesn’t stop me though; I still love the set."

Was expecting nothing more than a fancy light show, but I ended up getting performance for use and for looks. Lots of cool effects to play with on the mouse and keyboard, goes better with the pink than I was expecting. As a personal preference, I'm not big on the clickity clackity sound from the keys and the tactile reset, it's much louder than I anticipated based on the description. Hard to argue the value though, I got an amazing deal. If the sounds of the keys ends up bothering me too much, my daughter has already fallen in love with the look and feel and laid her claim to it."

        "review": "I've had this for about a year now and I've enjoyed it very much, but there are important caveats to be aware of. If I went back in time I would've purchased something a bit different.\n\nThe cabinet is actually 23\" deep door-to-back. I had to remove the back panel 'cause hardly anything fits in it otherwise. The side panels aren't very secure without the back, but they stay on just fine. It's advertised as a \"wall-mount\" - it seems rather large for that, but I got it because it was cheaper than other \"floor\" options. There's no attachment at the bottom for casters. Right now I have furniture risers underneath it, which prevents the sides from noisily shaking when I walk around (again, because I took the back off). The holes at the back aren't large enough to pass a power cable through, but they are big enough to pass a IEC 63020 (computer PSU style) plug through. You can get the reverse of a computer power cable and combine that with a regular power cable to run into a power bar if you're not using a UPS. Although, if you have the back panel off you can easily pass all kinds of wiring through it.\n\nOne thing I will say is it's very sturdy. I have a large heavy computer case sitting on top of the cabinet and it doesn't care in the slightest. I have a heavy 4U mount at the very top and it's been there for months.\n\nThe last thing to say about it is that it looks cool. I think that's a large part of the reason I got this one in particular. The glass door with the red accent - it looks like the powerhouse that it is."

If you have a router and switch trust me you will end up with a half dozen toaster sized appliances and wires going every which way. It looks awful and is impossible to maintain. Better to go with the pizza boxes mounted with screws in a vertical rack. The cables coming in and out can be zip tied together and labeled so they look neat. Same for power. Find a closet to tuck the whole thing into. The whole package could cost you a thousand bucks but for a couple hundred dollars SysRack will send you a cool looking locking cabinet with a glass door and blinking lights. Just like in the movies. Assembly is easy and best of all no more rat’s nest of phone lines, CATV cables, and Ethernet cables. You will keep it for years and when you move you just pick up the whole thing and take it with you so your streaming channels, online games and home automation thingies work just like before. Quality Canadian manufacturer, reliable service,\nand affordable future-proofing. Don’t be intimidated by networking jargon. Jump into your digital future with both feet. This cabinet is the best tech investment you can make."

That’s probably why all parts in the box were intact and in perfect shape. Assembly took no longer than 30 minutes and was really simple. I read other reviews about the hole lining up issue, but everything seemed to fit fine. It should just slip right into place and all holes line up perfectly. Otherwise, you’ll have to drill other holes like other reviewers say. The screws went in and tightened completely fine. Overall, the cabinet is sturdy enough for what I’m using and I’d recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a not expensive functional network cabinet. And yes... LOOKS FIRE too!"

        "review": "I really like it. My desktop is quite expensive...and I used to carry it around without this contraption, up and down 2 flights of stairs. Whenever I strap this brace on the PC, I ALWAYS feel anxious because it seems like it's not strong enough to carry 25, or so, pounds. Still, every time I use it, it works just fine and the handle always stays intact!\n\nI don't know if I would travel with this brace outside of my house, though. I could easily see myself walking through a crowd of people, at the airport, and somebody bumping into it and causing something to break or be damaged. After all, the case is totally exposed. Dents and scratches are to be expected, if you're not careful.\nOne thing that I do feel is disappointing, about the strap, are the carrying pockets. They're just not big enough for me to carry valuable items, alongside the PC, and feel comfortable that those items won't fall out - and some have. Luckily, no damage has ever come to a mouse or game controller that fell out.\nThe pockets could easily be made larger and more secure. An average-sized keyboard looks sketchy on the side of the brace because its form-factor is so tall that it will tilt a little bit. It'll probably never fall over, but it's just another concern that I have.\nIt's not worth it to carry important things inside those little pockets unless those things are small enough to be inconveniences (like a usb drive or a mouse pad).\n\nRegardless, the brace does its job VERY well and it enables me to travel with my desktop, more often than I should. As long as you clip it right and strap the velcro properly, your desktop will be safe in your hands."

The velcro (or magic, as the description states) straps are too long to wrap around my computer and still fasten.\n\nThe product is great quality and appears durable, but the description was very misleading for me, and now, I have a product that is not going to work as well as it should have."

        "review": "TL;DR: top power button and USB ports are defective *on my unit* while the restart button functions, but it's still a fantastic case; I just hate the glass and the distractingly annoying RGB lights that must be on at all times. I like the cable management, that was well thought-out!\n\nOh, what a saga. New-ish AAA game titles (specifically for me \"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands\" ) are now requiring a MINIMUM of 8gb of VRAM, so I decide to get a new card with ray tracing (which is a waste because \"Portal RTX\" is only for freaking expensive Nvidia cards, not cheaper AMDs).\n\nIt arrives, but is too long for my original case because, you know, MEASURING IS A GOOD THING that is easily forgotten in the throes of \"ooh new, modern and shiny!\" shopping sprees.\n\nAfter some research, reading and watching reviews, I decide on this case.\n\nThree days of struggling, swearing and constant insert/remove video card due to troubleshooting later, my husband and I find out that my tower is defective. The top power button and USB ports don't work, but the restart button does.\n\nMy husband tried the power switch from an old case he had, and that one worked, so yes, there is a defect. Oh well, at least my system turns on and works nicely now with new large-capacity SSDs and a faster, better video card in a well-ventilated case."

        "review": "I liked building two computers using this white case. There are a lot of features packed into this compact case, which would also make it a good choice for someone building a computer for the first time. My main complaint is the panel that covers where the cables go around to the back almost always has to slide to the second position. I had to do this both times because there was no other way that my 24-pin cable could fit through the gap at such a sharp angle. Now the cables in the back are visible. Another thing to consider is that if you're using PSU cable extensions, a non-modular PSU, and RGB controllers, then that HDD bay probably won't fit. Quality is quite good overall. The only place where it falls short is the bracket that holds the three fans on the side is a bit flimsy. Anyways, bought twice and happy with it both times. Comes with plenty of screws, zip ties, and two 3-pin fans."

        "review": "Nice looking case and fits an ATX board perfectly, it was my first pc build and i wasnt too stressed figuring this case out, comes with the cables on the back already organized and managed. Temps only reach 68c with an overclock to 5ghz and with the 3060 running the case doesnt really get that loud at all, when idle its really hard to hear it, i can only slightly hear the sound of my AIO.\nDefinitly can reccomend this case, Not sure if it can fit 40 series cards though like the 4090 but it fits my MSI 3060 Gaming x gpu, i also built a second pc and it was easy to install a micro atx aswell.\nThe only con id say is the fact there is only 1 usb port at the front but that doesnt bother me since my rear IO has like 8 ports and my keyboard has USB passthrough.\nI recomend buying the one with the fans, the one without rgb fans isnt really my favourite since its only controlled via voltage since it is only a 3 pin. Also they could make more room to more comfortably install a commander core XT but i managed to stuff it in there at the back."

        "review": "Après plusieurs mois d'utilisation, je suis vraiment impressionné par le boîtier CORSAIR. Voici ce que j'en pense en quelques points:\n\n----------- Design & Finitions :----------------\nLe boîtier offre une esthétique sobre et orientée Gamer, notamment avec le verre trempé qui permet d'exposer les composants internes du PC. C'est sans doute l'une des raisons principales pour lesquelles j'ai choisi ce modèle. Aussi il y a une version avec vitre avant ou avec grille, celle avec une grille a un meilleur airflow, mais j'ai investi sur un bon kit de refroidissement et j'ai pris le boitier avec une vitre avant car il est plus esthétique pour moi.\n\n------------- Éclairage RGB: ---------------\nLe système d'éclairage iCUE de CORSAIR ne déçoit jamais! J'ai pu personnaliser l'éclairage selon mes besoins et il est très facile à utiliser, et il se marie parfaitement avec le reste de mon setup.\n\n---------------Air Flow:-------------\nJ'utilise plusieurs ventilateurs et le boîtier est conçu pour permettre une circulation d'air optimale. Même pendant les sessions de jeu gourmandes, ce qui est un gros plus pour moi.\n\n--------------Espace & Modularité:-----------------------\nBien que qualifié de \"moyen tour\", le 4000X offre suffisamment d'espace pour tous mes composants, et j'apprécie vraiment sa modularité qui m'a permis de gérer facilement le cable management.\n\n------------Facilité d'installation: ---------------\nLe montage a été un jeu d'enfant. Tous les emplacements sont clairement identifiés et accessibles.\n\nCependant, rien n'est parfait. J'aurais aimé avoir peut-être quelques passages de câbles supplémentaires ou des options de personnalisation (quelques câbles restes bien visibles sur les photos), mais ce sont des détails mineurs au vu de la qualité générale de ce boîtier.\n\n---------------Conclusion :------------------\nJe recommande vivement le CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB à quiconque cherche un boîtier PC alliant esthétique, performance et qualité de construction. Je recommande vivement !"

        "review": "I recently upgraded my PC case to the CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB, and I must say, it's been a fantastic addition to my setup. Here's my unbiased review of this product.\n\nPros:\n\nStunning RGB Lighting: The RGB lighting on this case is a showstopper. The three included SP120 RGB Elite fans illuminate your PC with vibrant, customizable colors. The iCUE software allows you to sync the lighting with other Corsair peripherals, creating a visually cohesive gaming or work environment.\n\nExcellent Build Quality: The case feels solid and well-constructed. The tempered glass side panel provides a clear view of your components, and it's easy to remove for maintenance or upgrades.\n\nGreat Cable Management: Corsair has designed this case with cable management in mind. There are plenty of cable routing channels and tie-down points, helping you achieve a clean and organized interior.\n\nAirflow: Despite the emphasis on aesthetics, Corsair hasn't compromised on airflow. The front panel has a mesh design that allows for adequate ventilation, keeping your components cool even during demanding tasks.\n\nSpacious Interior: The 4000X offers ample space for ATX motherboards and high-end GPUs. It also supports multiple storage options, including SSD trays and HDD cages.\n\nEasy Installation: Installing components in this case is a breeze, thanks to the well-thought-out layout. The tool-free drive bays and PCIe slot covers make the build process smoother.\n\nCons:\n\nPrice: While the features and quality are top-notch, the price point may be a bit high for some users. However, considering the included RGB fans and overall build quality, it's a reasonable investment for enthusiasts.\n\nLimited Radiator Support: If you plan on using a large liquid cooling setup, the radiator support might be a bit limited, especially at the front. You'll need to ensure that your chosen components fit within the case's dimensions.\n\nIn summary, the CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case is an outstanding choice for gamers and PC enthusiasts who prioritize aesthetics without sacrificing functionality. It offers a stunning RGB lighting experience, excellent build quality, and efficient cable management. While it comes at a premium price, it's a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to showcase their PC components in style."

        "review": "Je suis absolument ravi de partager mon expérience avec le boîtier PC de chez Corsair. Dès le déballage, j'ai été séduit par son design moderne et élégant. Avec ses ventilateurs avant RGB qui illuminent subtilement mon espace de jeu, il ajoute une touche esthétique incomparable à ma configuration. Mais ce n'est pas que de l'apparence ! Ce boîtier offre une expérience d'installation et de gestion de câbles exceptionnelle.\n\nL'un des points forts incontestables de ce boîtier est sa facilité d'installation des composants. Les emplacements parfaitement conçus permettent de monter les cartes graphiques, les disques durs et les alimentations sans aucun tracas. Même pour quelqu'un comme moi, qui n'est pas un expert en assemblage de PC, l'expérience a été fluide et sans embûches.\n\nLa gestion des câbles est un autre aspect remarquable. Grâce aux passages intelligemment placés, j'ai pu dissimuler habilement tous les câbles disgracieux, offrant ainsi un aspect soigné et bien organisé à l'intérieur du boîtier. Cette fonctionnalité s'est avérée essentielle pour maintenir une circulation d'air optimale et garder mon système au frais pendant de longues sessions de jeu intenses.\n\nLes vitres latérales et en façade ajoutent une touche de transparence qui met en valeur l'ensemble de ma configuration. C'est un plaisir de pouvoir admirer mes composants et de montrer fièrement mon travail d'assemblage. Corsair a vraiment pensé à tout pour offrir aux utilisateurs un spectacle visuel incroyable, à l'intérieur comme à l'extérieur du boîtier.\n\nMais ce n'est pas seulement une question d'apparence. La qualité de construction du boîtier est exceptionnelle. Les matériaux robustes utilisés inspirent confiance et je sais que mes composants sont entre de bonnes mains. Le boîtier offre également une excellente isolation phonique, ce qui réduit considérablement le bruit de fonctionnement de mes composants, offrant ainsi une expérience de jeu plus immersive et agréable.\n\nEn résumé, le boîtier PC Corsair avec RGB et vitres latérales est un véritable bijou de technologie et de style. Il allie parfaitement le design moderne avec des fonctionnalités pratiques, comme une installation facile des composants et une gestion de câbles ingénieuse. Les vitres ajoutent une touche visuelle impressionnante, tandis que la qualité de construction assure une durabilité à toute épreuve. Si vous cherchez à donner un coup de boost à votre setup gaming tout en restant fidèle à la qualité, ce boîtier est un choix incontournable. Corsair a vraiment frappé fort avec ce modèle, et je ne peux que le recommander à tous les passionnés de PC qui veulent un boîtier à la hauteur de leurs attentes les plus élevées."

        "review": "I had a prebuilt I bought a long time ago that I basically have upgraded into a new PC over the years. The only thing I haven't replaced is the case by this point. My old case wasn't awful, but it began to fall apart, and I always wanted a white PC case so I decided to give in and get this one! I don't regret it at all so far. It was really easy to set up, and the cable management is way better than other cases I have worked with (I have worked on a few PC's for my brother and friends as well). I also love how this case is a mid sized tower, but somehow has so much room? I found it much easier to work with compared to my old case, which was a large sized tower. Everything is really easy to remove and put back together, and it came with extra zip ties, velcro strips, and screws for fans and screwing in the motherboard, which is super nice. The only thing that I noticed was it doesn't fit a 140mm fan at the back of the case, which is what I had in my old case (this is user error, I didn't double check this. Just wanted to mention in case anyone might be unaware too). But the case came with two simple black 120 mm fans so I just used one of those no problem. It looks great and I am super happy with it!"

Before you buy this case you need to measure your parts you plan to put in the thing. Obviously from the picture i provided my 6900xt BARELY fit. Also limited me to top mount on the CPU radiator. But that is because i out a big boy in there. This case is 240mm ONLY! If they would have designed the top of the case just a SMALL fraction wider i may have been able to get a 280mm AIO up there. You could get a 280mm in the front panel if you have a smaller card and put the fans on the front side of the metal panel. At the end of the day this is a compact PC case so no lost love on these comments.\n\nThe front panel is easy to take off and allows good airflow so far. The little mesh filter that comes with it is a little flimsy but i truly could care less. If it fails or gets bad i’ll just cut a new mesh piece to replace it. LOVE the removable mount at front for the fans. Was able to install the fans OUTSIDE of the case and then pop it right in. Made the install so much simpler. The GPU bottom fan is unique and stands apart from any other case right now. I feel like it fits well with the case and serves a noble purpose keeping my 6900 xt cooler. The angle it gets actually hits my GPU’s exhaust coil perfect. But take note that it limited any extra room at the bottom for hard drives or long PSU’s. They did put a small mount for two right behind the motherboard if you need them. The mount comes off the case and it is easy to install the drives. I just use M.2 so i have no use. Decided to place my fan hub there Instead!\n\nAir flow so far has not been an issue and i’m keeping steady on all my parts getting a nice breeze. I put 2 140mm Arctic front fans and 1 Arctic 120mm on the back exhaust. They are SILENT but this case also does okay at keeping any other noise suppressed.\n\nNZXT is king at cable management and i really like the orientation of where to throw my cables. They give you a lot of different ways to work. Very large cut out at the top for the motherboard/fan/whatever cables that needs to go at the top. Makes working in it very easy. And this case did everyone a favor by putting all front panel cables into just ONE plug in. No more using a magnifying glass to see where the power switch and what not go on the motherboard!\n\nOverall a 4/5 case. I think it is better suited being a little cheaper sell point because of lack of fans. But if you’re going to upgrade the fans anyways (like me) then it is still a great buy. I’m not mad i bought the case. I’d even consider buying it again for a new build one day."

        "review": "It was easy to set up and has decent built-in cable guides on the back side to keep things relatively organized. It did not come with enough screws to properly mount the motherboard though. I got four though, I've seen others report getting 5 or 6.\nThe side panel locking thumbscrews are not aligned quite right and came crossthreaded, but it was an easy job to get them loose and attached 'correctly'. Definitely not the worst flaws one can encounter for a relatively cheap case."

        "review": "Purchased the GAMDIAS Apollo E2 Elite for a Intel Core i5-12600k system that I just built paired with a\nThermalright PS120SE ARGB CPU Air Cooler.\n\nBuild quality: Honestly didn't have many complaints the case includes a tempered glass front panel and a tempered glass side panel that is on a removable door hinge and includes magnets to keep it closed. The quality of the hinge seems to be really good and its easy to remove and easy to open / close. The metal the chassis is made out of didn't have any noticeable sharp edges which was really nice.\n\nHard drive cage: The hard-drive cage is probably the only negative thing about the chassis, it is screwed into the case from the underside of the case which can make removing it / installing it a bit of a nuisance but overall its not a dealbreaker just something worth noting. Since I used a WD SN770 2TB Black NVME SSD I removed the hard-drive cage completely to free up space for all the cables from the non-modular PSU that I used. With the hard-drive cage installed it can make bundling up your excessive PSU cables a bit of a pain but it is manageable and possible if you decide to leave it in.\n\n200MM Intake Fans: The included 200MM Intake fans are really nice and don't seem to make too much audible noise and I am really happy with them, the case also includes a LED button on the front panel that lets you change the colours as well as disable the ARGB LEDS altogether if you're not a fan of bright LEDS\n\nOverall Impressions: For the price of the chassis I will probably end up using it with more builds in the future as I was really impressed with it. Large 200MM Intake fans and an overall really nice quality built chassis! If you found this review helpful check out my YT Neils Tech I hope to be posting more in 2024!\n\nThanks for reading!"

        "review": "I assembled my new PC using this case it's quite spacious and the LED fans are very bright and colourful and are easily controlled by the argb ports on the motherboard. The speed of the 2 fans in the front cannot be controlled by the motherboard (they are always on at whatever speed), but the speed of the rear case fan can be controlled via the motherboard. Fairly easy to cable manage in the case. The HDD cage cannot be removed in the bottom of the case. After I assembled my PC I peeled the plastic film off the glass panel on the front and noticed a small bubble in the glass from when the piece was made and small chip in the corner of the glass. After I assembled I didnt want to disassemble to return the case, so I decided to live with it, so check everything out on the case before you begin.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI reached out to the company about the chip on the bezel and they shipped me a new one within the week. GAMDIAS does stand behind their product. A quick tip do not use their site for reporting warranty issues go to their discord channel. They monitor that more frequently and are more responsive. I'm raising their rating to 4 because of the support I received. I can't give them a 5 because if the initial issue, but they did fix the problem in short order."

There isn't that much room for the PSU, if you're getting a fully modular PSU you might have space problems, I fixed it by taking the HDD holder out since I'm using an SSD and an m.2 overall solid build"

It looks great, it has a PSU shroud, 3 included fan, 2 of them being massive 240mm fans, included RGB controller button, tempered glass side panel, and there's a fair amount of room inside. My complaint is the metal quality, which is fairly thin, the cable management space in the back could be better, and I wished there would've been rubber grommets to hide the cable holes. Overall, it's a good case, especially if you can get it below 80$. But for the price I paid (110$ CAD) I wished I could've had a bit more. It's the same price I paid for my Inwin 303, which is a much more durable and well-made case in my opinion.\n\nIt's my first time trying GAMDIAS products. I wouldn't say I'm impressed, but I would consider them if their prices were a bit lower for Canada. Other than that, fairly good case, and it looks wonderful"

I appreciated the customizability of this case. I could fit a large video card (ARC 770) easily and I knew it'd fit beforehand because the dimensions were clearly defined on the market page. I was able to remove parts I didn't need with ease and the whole thing still feels solid. I love the big window so I can easily see the innards of my system (and the colors). There's lots of pass-through spaces on the motherboard mount to pass cables through to keep things looking nice and neat. I think this is my favorite case I've ever had and I've been building systems since the 90's. Very nice!"

The hard drive cage has two positions or can be removed entirely by 2 screws to fit a longer PSU if needed. Plenty of holes for wire management and a nice sized wire area behind the back panel. The glass panel came with plastic peel on both sides of the panel, which doesn't seem to be common but is a nice touch. Doesn't have rubber grommets around the wire holes but that is ok for the price, you could go up 30-40$ in case tiers to get those if they are important to you. Remember to remove the PCIe slot covers you will need open from the case before inserting the motherboard.\n\nThe case is visually nice as well, the white and black design looks good with a variety of component colors on the inside, you should be able to match almost anything with it.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the case did not come with a little screw bit to help put the motherboard stand offs in. Personally this does not matter to me as I have them already and other screw bits in my set. But for someone missing it, it does make inserting the standoffs straight a bit more difficult, Although it can be done by hand if needed, it will just be a bit more frustrating to do.\n\nA decent case."

The top power button and USB ports don't work, but the restart button does.\n\nMy husband tried the power switch from an old case he had, and that one worked, so yes, there is a defect.

        "review": "I liked building two computers using this white case. There are a lot of features packed into this compact case, which would also make it a good choice for someone building a computer for the first time. My main complaint is the panel that covers where the cables go around to the back almost always has to slide to the second position. I had to do this both times because there was no other way that my 24-pin cable could fit through the gap at such a sharp angle. Now the cables in the back are visible. Another thing to consider is that if you're using PSU cable extensions, a non-modular PSU, and RGB controllers, then that HDD bay probably won't fit. Quality is quite good overall. The only place where it falls short is the bracket that holds the three fans on the side is a bit flimsy. Anyways, bought twice and happy with it both times. Comes with plenty of screws, zip ties, and two 3-pin fans."

Temps only reach 68c with an overclock to 5ghz and with the 3060 running the case doesnt really get that loud at all, when idle its really hard to hear it, i can only slightly hear the sound of my AIO.\nDefinitly can reccomend this case, Not sure if it can fit 40 series cards though like the 4090 but it fits my MSI 3060 Gaming x gpu, i also built a second pc and it was easy to install a micro atx aswell.\nThe only con id say is the fact there is only 1 usb port at the front but that doesnt bother me since my rear IO has like 8 ports and my keyboard has USB passthrough.\nI recomend buying the one with the fans, the one without rgb fans isnt really my favourite since its only controlled via voltage since it is only a 3 pin. Also they could make more room to more comfortably install a commander core XT but i managed to stuff it in there at the back."

Voici ce que j'en pense en quelques points:\n\n----------- Design & Finitions :----------------\nLe boîtier offre une esthétique sobre et orientée Gamer, notamment avec le verre trempé qui permet d'exposer les composants internes du PC. C'est sans doute l'une des raisons principales pour lesquelles j'ai choisi ce modèle. Aussi il y a une version avec vitre avant ou avec grille, celle avec une grille a un meilleur airflow, mais j'ai investi sur un bon kit de refroidissement et j'ai pris le boitier avec une vitre avant car il est plus esthétique pour moi.\n\n------------- Éclairage RGB: ---------------\nLe système d'éclairage iCUE de CORSAIR ne déçoit jamais! J'ai pu personnaliser l'éclairage selon mes besoins et il est très facile à utiliser, et il se marie parfaitement avec le reste de mon setup.\n\n---------------Air Flow:-------------\nJ'utilise plusieurs ventilateurs et le boîtier est conçu pour permettre une circulation d'air optimale. Même pendant les sessions de jeu gourmandes, ce qui est un gros plus pour moi.\n\n--------------Espace & Modularité:-----------------------\nBien que qualifié de \"moyen tour\", le 4000X offre suffisamment d'espace pour tous mes composants, et j'apprécie vraiment sa modularité qui m'a permis de gérer facilement le cable management.\n\n------------Facilité d'installation: ---------------\nLe montage a été un jeu d'enfant. Tous les emplacements sont clairement identifiés et accessibles.\n\nCependant, rien n'est parfait. J'aurais aimé avoir peut-être quelques passages de câbles supplémentaires ou des options de personnalisation (quelques câbles restes bien visibles sur les photos), mais ce sont des détails mineurs au vu de la qualité générale de ce boîtier.\n\n---------------Conclusion :------------------\nJe recommande vivement le CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB à quiconque cherche un boîtier PC alliant esthétique, performance et qualité de construction. Je recommande vivement !"

        "review": "I recently upgraded my PC case to the CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB, and I must say, it's been a fantastic addition to my setup. Here's my unbiased review of this product.\n\nPros:\n\nStunning RGB Lighting: The RGB lighting on this case is a showstopper. The three included SP120 RGB Elite fans illuminate your PC with vibrant, customizable colors. The iCUE software allows you to sync the lighting with other Corsair peripherals, creating a visually cohesive gaming or work environment.\n\nExcellent Build Quality: The case feels solid and well-constructed. The tempered glass side panel provides a clear view of your components, and it's easy to remove for maintenance or upgrades.\n\nGreat Cable Management: Corsair has designed this case with cable management in mind. There are plenty of cable routing channels and tie-down points, helping you achieve a clean and organized interior.\n\nAirflow: Despite the emphasis on aesthetics, Corsair hasn't compromised on airflow. The front panel has a mesh design that allows for adequate ventilation, keeping your components cool even during demanding tasks.\n\nSpacious Interior: The 4000X offers ample space for ATX motherboards and high-end GPUs. It also supports multiple storage options, including SSD trays and HDD cages.\n\nEasy Installation: Installing components in this case is a breeze, thanks to the well-thought-out layout. The tool-free drive bays and PCIe slot covers make the build process smoother.\n\nCons:\n\nPrice: While the features and quality are top-notch, the price point may be a bit high for some users. However, considering the included RGB fans and overall build quality, it's a reasonable investment for enthusiasts.\n\nLimited Radiator Support: If you plan on using a large liquid cooling setup, the radiator support might be a bit limited, especially at the front. You'll need to ensure that your chosen components fit within the case's dimensions.\n\nIn summary, the CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case is an outstanding choice for gamers and PC enthusiasts who prioritize aesthetics without sacrificing functionality. It offers a stunning RGB lighting experience, excellent build quality, and efficient cable management. While it comes at a premium price, it's a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to showcase their PC components in style."

Avec ses ventilateurs avant RGB qui illuminent subtilement mon espace de jeu, il ajoute une touche esthétique incomparable à ma configuration. Mais ce n'est pas que de l'apparence ! Ce boîtier offre une expérience d'installation et de gestion de câbles exceptionnelle.\n\nL'un des points forts incontestables de ce boîtier est sa facilité d'installation des composants. Les emplacements parfaitement conçus permettent de monter les cartes graphiques, les disques durs et les alimentations sans aucun tracas. Même pour quelqu'un comme moi, qui n'est pas un expert en assemblage de PC, l'expérience a été fluide et sans embûches.\n\nLa gestion des câbles est un autre aspect remarquable. Grâce aux passages intelligemment placés, j'ai pu dissimuler habilement tous les câbles disgracieux, offrant ainsi un aspect soigné et bien organisé à l'intérieur du boîtier. Cette fonctionnalité s'est avérée essentielle pour maintenir une circulation d'air optimale et garder mon système au frais pendant de longues sessions de jeu intenses.\n\nLes vitres latérales et en façade ajoutent une touche de transparence qui met en valeur l'ensemble de ma configuration. C'est un plaisir de pouvoir admirer mes composants et de montrer fièrement mon travail d'assemblage. Corsair a vraiment pensé à tout pour offrir aux utilisateurs un spectacle visuel incroyable, à l'intérieur comme à l'extérieur du boîtier.\n\nMais ce n'est pas seulement une question d'apparence. La qualité de construction du boîtier est exceptionnelle. Les matériaux robustes utilisés inspirent confiance et je sais que mes composants sont entre de bonnes mains. Le boîtier offre également une excellente isolation phonique, ce qui réduit considérablement le bruit de fonctionnement de mes composants, offrant ainsi une expérience de jeu plus immersive et agréable.\n\nEn résumé, le boîtier PC Corsair avec RGB et vitres latérales est un véritable bijou de technologie et de style. Il allie parfaitement le design moderne avec des fonctionnalités pratiques, comme une installation facile des composants et une gestion de câbles ingénieuse. Les vitres ajoutent une touche visuelle impressionnante, tandis que la qualité de construction assure une durabilité à toute épreuve.

My old case wasn't awful, but it began to fall apart, and I always wanted a white PC case so I decided to give in and get this one! I don't regret it at all so far. It was really easy to set up, and the cable management is way better than other cases I have worked with (I have worked on a few PC's for my brother and friends as well). I also love how this case is a mid sized tower, but somehow has so much room? I found it much easier to work with compared to my old case, which was a large sized tower. Everything is really easy to remove and put back together, and it came with extra zip ties, velcro strips, and screws for fans and screwing in the motherboard, which is super nice. The only thing that I noticed was it doesn't fit a 140mm fan at the back of the case, which is what I had in my old case (this is user error, I didn't double check this. Just wanted to mention in case anyone might be unaware too). But the case came with two simple black 120 mm fans so I just used one of those no problem. It looks great and I am super happy with it!"

I found a few hairs in the case. Luckily it did not have scratch mark/missing parts). But don't get me wrong, the case is great and here are the reasons:\n\nThe case is very affordable (Especially when it is on sale, I got it at $4x dollar). Basically you cannot find any other case at this price range.\n\nThe case is roomy and can fit a few SSDs. The case is also long enough to hold a long graphics card. It provide a lot of holes on the back panel for cable management.\n\nThe only down side is it only comes with a fan on the back but I guess I cannot complain that in this price range."

Il plexy è fissato al case con 4 viti molto comode, queste 4 viti sono facilmente removibili grazie al loro grip anche con le dita.\nFornita in dotazione vi è anche una ventola sempre Cooler Master, che io personalmente ho lasciato nella parte posteriore del case per \"buttare fuori l'aria\" dal case, è una ventola 3 pin con velocità NON regolabile che risulta molto silenziosa e comunque valida da utilizzare anche se non personalizzabile, fosse stata rumorosa non l'avrei tenuta sinceramente perché si parla di una ventola basica da pochi euro.\n\nIl case sarebbe di per se molto \"nudo\" esteticamente se non fosse per i due pannelli con grafiche magnetici. Questi due \"pannelli\" magnetici sono molto importanti perché oltre a fare da filtri dell'aria fungono anche da elemento estetico ricoprendo la struttura bucherellata del case stesso. Personalmente trovo il design e la grafica davvero belli e li tengo sempre montati.\nI due pannelli sono prima di tutto intercambiabili tra di loro (anche se sono identici) poi possono essere smontati semplicemente sollevandoli senza alcuna difficoltà ed inoltre aderiscono perfettamente alla superficie del case tramite i magneti \"flessibili\" che sono davvero ben fatti.\n\nIl pannello laterale è realizzato in plastica, presenta due porte USB 3.0 un ingresso microfono jack audio da 3,5mm, un ingresso cuffie audio da 3,5mm, vi è poi un piccolo tasto per il reset del pc ed un centrale e grande tasto di accensione, in generale anche questo pannello per me risulta ben fatto e funzionale, forse avrei preferito un tasto reset un pelo più grande ma in ogni caso funziona tutto perfettamente.\n\n- SPAZIO E FUNZIONALITA' -\n\nQuesto case è piccolo, ma con TANTO SPAZIO DENTRO!\n\nAdoro la disposizione interna delle lamiere che permettono davvero tanto \"spazio di manovra\" in fase di assemblaggio e che sopratutto permette di avere all'interno del \"piccolo\" case un GRANDE spazio per allocare tutte le componenti.\nLe componenti possono essere sistemate con un alto grado di personalizzazione, dalla scheda madre all'alimentatore, dal dissipatore alle ventole si può andare a costruire davvero un bel pc in questo piccoletto.\n\nOvviamente questo è un case adatto a schede madri di TIPO MICRO ATX/MINI ITX e quindi bisogna assolutamente considerare questo importantissimo dettaglio prima di acquistare.\nDetto ciò e considerato che non si andrà di certo ad assemblare su un case da 35 euro un pc da 2000 euro (anche se si potrebbe) dico che questo case è più che ottimo per realizzare comunque un ottima configurazione.\n\nCome dicevo lo spazio all'interno può essere organizzato proprio come vogliamo, le cose che si possono fare sono molteplici:\n\n-C'è la possibilità come nei case più costosi di \"esporre\" i propri ssd sulla parte frontale con un sistema molto semplice e funzionale a viti e gommini che vanno posizionati semplicemente.\n\n-C'è la possibilità di montate un piccolo AIO a liquido con radiatore da 120mm a 240mm ANTERIORMENTE o fino a 120mm nella parte POSTERIORE (poi nel sito del produttore vi sono le specifiche più nel dettaglio)\n\n-C'è la possibilità di montare anche un bel dissipatore ad aria con doppia ventola bello grosso come ho fato io e vedrete dalle foto\n\n-Si può effettuare un cable management davvero di qualità nascondendo tutti i cavi alla perfezione grazie agli spazi ben studiati e comodi dove passare i cavi, nella parte posteriore vi sono ben 28 millimetri di spazio ricavato apposta per inserire diversi cavi comodamente.\n\n- Ci stanno sulla parte anteriore due ventole da 120/140 millimetri, sulla parte superiore due ventole da 120/140 e sulla parte posteriore una ventola fino a 120mm.\n\n- Ci stanno delle schede video anche importanti, io su questa configurazione ho temporaneamente installato una GTX 580, una scheda che è assolutamente IGNORANTE sopratutto in dimensioni, prende ben 3 slot posteriori ed è davvero grossa, più della mia 1070 montata sul pc principale! Quindi figuriamoci quante schede sono compatibili con questo spazio!\n\nScendendo nei dettagli specifici le dimensioni massime delle componenti utilizzabili (come descritto dal costruttore) sono:\n-159 millimetri (15.9 cm) di altezza massima per i dissipatori\n-360 millimetri (36 cm) di lunghezza massima per le schede video\n-160 millimetri (16 cm) di lunghezza massima per gli alimentatori\n\nOttimo è anche dal punto di vista del flusso d'aria interno, niente da dire nemmeno da questo punto di vista in quanto risulta un case che permette degli ottimi flussi se la disposizione delle ventole viene ben studiata ovviamente, disposizione che però è davvero semplice creare grazie agli spazi già ben predisposti! Bastano due ventole anteriori ad aspirare ed una ventola posteriore e superiore a buttare fuori l'aria ed il gioco è bello che fatto.\nFino ad ora e lo utilizzo da mesi non ho avuto il minimo problema di surriscaldamento ne di temperature in generale nonostante la mia scheda video sia un vero e proprio \"fornetto\" da pizza che raggiunge gli 80 gradi a volte solo guardandola.\n\n- PERSONALIZZAZIONE -\n\nEccellente, questo case è completamente modulare e può essere modificato in ogni sua parte.\n\n- Il pannello laterale (con usb, tasto accensione ecc..) può essere completamente smontato e riposizionato e ruotato come e vogliamo.\n\n- il pannello inferiore (la base del case) può essere svitata e riposizionata per \"ruotare\" il case a piacimento.\n\n- Sulla parte posteriore troviamo fino a 4 slot smontabili per le varie schede audio/video ecc..\n\n- I Filtri per l'aria sono intercambiabili, removibili a piacimento ed anche molto semplici da pulire.\n\nPossiamo insomma sbizzarrirci su come assemblare il case con una personalizzazione davvero ampia per la sua fascia sempre di prezzo/categoria.\n\n- COME LO UTILIZZO IO -\n\nBeh l'ho scelto per un semplice motivo, volevo realizzare un buon pc \"secondario\" non da gioco ma dedicato alla navigazione/stampa 3d e controllo di stampanti in generale, nulla di impegnativo insomma, cercavo un contenitore per delle componenti che suppur datate considero ancora valide e che volevo \"racchiudere\" in un buon case.\nIn sostanza parlo di una mobo z77 micro atx, cpu i7 3700k, dissipatore ARTIC freezer 34 con doppia ventola da 120mm, alimentatore EVGA 500w 80+ BRONZE, scheda video gtx 580, ssd da 240 giga e hdd meccanico da 1 tera, il tutto condito da 2 ventole da 120mm corsair poste anteriormente ed una sempre corsair da 140mm posta nella parte sopra, niente di impressionante ma tutto più che funzionante anche grazie a questo case che è riuscito a racchiudere tutto EGREGIAMENTE.\n\n- CONSIDERAZIONI FINALI E.. LO CONSIGLIO? -\n\nChe dire, io personalmente lo adoro, sembra un case da nulla ed invece fa sembrare questo pc secondario una Bomba, ripensando poi quanto l'ho pagato quasi mi metto a ridere. Ben 35 euro per questo case secondo me vale SEMPRE la pena di spenderli, anche perché non ho mai trovato un case a così basso prezzo con tutte queste caratteristiche.\n\nCerto non è privo di difetti, questo è chiaro, come ad esempio che molte parti siano realizzate in plastica sottile, come per il fatto che non vi è un \"copri alimentatore\" che possa meglio nascondere i cavi e l'alimentatore con cavi annessi rimarranno \"a vista\", come ancora che il pannello trasparente non sia in vetro ma in plexyglass che tenderà nel tempo a graffiarsi solo guardandolo, MA in linea di massima io ci ho trovato più pregi che difetti sinceramente. Difetti che posso lasciarmi alle spalle anche perché se volevo di più non stavo qua a spendere 35 euro ma andavo per prodotti molto ben più costosi sicuramente.\n\nIl mio verdetto definitivo è quindi che SE cercate un buon case per una configurazione micro/mini ATX, e SE magari volete spendere poco ma ottenere Tantissimo, questo secondo me è un ottimo prodotto al quale affidarvi, senza alcun dubbio per me.\nSono stato personalmente ripagato da un buon risultato finale, una facilità di assemblaggio e spazio di lavoro ottimo, un prezzo eccellente con annesso risparmio per acquisto di altre componenti e quindi mi sento di CONSIGLIARLO al 100% senza nessunissimo dubbio per me!"

In theory this allows flexibility, but for my build, it not being hard mounted (and thus the space its cabling not being factored into design) means I had to put in an awkward place; a full length GPU prevents right hand mounting and a tall CPU cooler prevents top mounting.\n\nThe only real drawback with this case comes from modern motherboards and GPUs. Moderns GPUs can be THREE SLOTS THICK (!) and take up space. On the first motherboard I used, this was not a problem, but the PCI on the second board was lower, so the clearance between the GPU and PSU is far too small for comfort."

If you read reviews, the must-have for this case is two front fans, once they are added the cooling ability of this case really excels. The neat feature is the fan at the bottom of the case blowing up at the GPU. Easy install, lots of space to hide things. It really is beautiful, I got the white one and added some LEDS and I still love looking at it."

The one thing I would say, is try to assemble the majority of the motherboard before you mount it in the case. It will save you some headache during the overall assembly of your rig. The cable management is good and it's nice having easy access to the hard drive mounts on the backside of the motherboard. Overall, very pleased with this purchase.

There are no external bays! But most computers do not include these drives as they are being phased out.\nThe strengths of this case are sturdiness, flexibility to route wiring, room to allow oversized heatsinks, and lots of add-on ports. It is a very heavy case (about 15 pounds empty). It has plenty of room for gaming video cards as you can see in my photo.\nIt is a builder's delight as it is open and roomy when you remove the tempered glass side. Most of the bulky (ugly) wiring can be hidden in the bottom compartment leaving a beautiful, clean finished build. I did have a little trouble opening the tempered glass side. There is just one tab, and you have to give it a pretty good tug before it breaks loose from its tight seal, at least that's how mine was. I also installed one as a server at a dentist's office. If allowed, I would give it a 4.5-star rating."

The case fans and current cooling solution on my build is able to keep my dual xeons ~30c idle and I struggle to get it able 50c even with a full load. The whole time the computer is nearly silent! Over all I think it looks great! Issues I had, which are more so a function of the mother board I am using, are only 75% of the mounting holes lined up and I had issues routing my 24 pin. I also wished that every time the computer turns off the assigned rgb colors would not go back to the default rainbow."

First the case fans, they are RGB however they are ring style RGB fans and the pictures are a bit misleading in this way. Second There is no front air filter, so there is nothing to keep dust and dirt from being sucked into your system. Third is the side panels, when you remove the thumb screws in the back the glass panel starts to fall away from the case. If you need a cheap case to hold cheap parts this is an ok case, if you have expensive parts then send an extra 30-40 and get something better."

Even with a white mobo, and aio cooler you can’t see anything with the PC off and can only kinda of see things a bit with all the RGB on. So if you want to build in this case don’t worry what components you use because you can see them anyways lol."

        "review": "The reasons I order the Corsair 5000D was because I wanted space to manage my cables, the ability to add up to 10 fans for great airflow, and I wanted a sleek looking case. This case delivered on all of my needs. There's so much space for cable management and all your hard drives so everything looks clean and tidy. I went with the Thermalright Phantom Spirit CPU air cooler, it's a big (similar to the Noctua NH-D15), so I needed space and airflow. The cooler fits in easily and there's a ton of airflow. My i7 13700k doesn't go over 32 degrees Celsius on idle and when I did a few CPU stress tests it never went over 85 degrees Celsius. The build quality is top notch and it definitely looks way better in person (especially in black). So sleek!\nIf you're looking for a case with airflow, enough space for a big CPU cooler, and a graphics giant card (I know, mine isn't in the photos) this is the case for you. I highly recommend it and well done Corsair!👍🏼"

        "review": "This is an awesome case...if you don't plan on using the HDD cage. This is absolutely perfect if you only plan on using SSD drives and M.2 drives.\n\nThere are several design flaws with this case otherwise I would have given it a 5/5 review.\n\nHuge Flaw one: HDD cage is an absolute nightmare to deal with. The default position of the cage is VERY close to where the power supply sits. You will have cable issues even with a normal sized modular PSU. Personally I think the designers should throw out the 3 side fan mounts and move the HDD cage much closer to the front of the case away from the PSU. Unfortunately if you get ride of the 3 side fan mount you also lose important cable management grab points. Did the designers actually try this out in the real world?\n\nFlaw two: On the glass side of the case (right next to motherboard) there is a cover plate that helps hide all your cables that come in from the back side. It is a great idea to keep everything pretty. However the designers did NOT give enough clearance. My EVGA power supply cable that feeds the motherboard had one heck of time fitting in place because of this cover plate. I was very tempted to rip the plate out because it put a LOT of tension on the cable (the neck of the cable is reinforced and therefore thick). In the end I had to put the cable at an odd angle to make it fit but I am still worried about long term damage.\n\nFlaw three: Why does the front of the case only come with 1 fan? I knew it beforehand so I wasn't surprised and pre-ordered 2 extra non-rgb fans. Ridiculous though that I had to do this.\n\nOther than these 3 flaws this case is awesome. I love the magnetic fan filter covers! I love the easy access to the top and front fans with snap on covers. The case feels very much a deluxe case but the designers need to revisit and fix the flaws."

This was tripping a sensor for me and causing a reboot. I replaced the panel with a normal one(same as the other side) and all is good. Besides that, the case is amazing."

Either way I am sure it will be likely hit and miss, I would suggest checking your case as soon as it arrives to make sure it isnt' faulty in some way that makes it unusable for you...\n\nMy 4 stars for Value for money is more like a 3.75, as I have to take some off for that QC issues..."

        "review": "Didn't add a photo as it's late at night when writing this review and honestly, the pictures that showcase the product to a good job at showing the most important aspects to it. To make this the easiest to digest, I'll make a pros and cons list really quickly & expand more at the bottom if needed.\n\nPros : This case is EXTREMELY spacious compared to its little brother the 4000D. Prior to getting this case when I was cross-checking specs for GPU clearance among other things, the 5000D just made the most sense when you consider how massive partner cards are getting & the multitude of ways a person can set their airflow up. Having not only the front panel, but also the side panel directly next to it for a total of 6 intake fans if you're wild enough, with plenty of room at the top of the case for either a radiator or rear exhaust to compliment the back exhaust fan. Plenty of cable ties, so many I'd be shocked if any person in the world uses the amount Corsair supplies, but better to have them and not need them than need them & not have them. A PSU end-panel shroud & side panel shroud (side panel shroud in the case you're not planning on having fans mounted to the side panel) to make things look very well cable managed & hides any not-so-great cable management as well. Easy to remove hard drive bays for more PSU cable space. Included 90 degree USB 3 header which was an unexpected but very much appreciated inclusion. Ease of access to every panel & dust filter throughout the entirety of the case. Overall a very good for future proofing case (although we don't like to say future proof in the tech world, this case seems to be a safe bet). All in all, if you install some really high quality fans in here, you're basically guaranteed some very acceptable temperatures from your hardware as this case when setup up accordingly MOVES AIR.\n\nCons - The rubber grommets that you use to manage your cables through one side of the case to the other are not the best quality. If you're planning of forcing that 24 pin mobo connector through the rubber grommet, keep this in mind. If gentle and not too forceful (unlike I was) then you'll have no issues. I on the other hand, managed to someone apply enough for the outright remove whatever adhesive was keeping the grommet bonded to the metal case. Now I have to be extra careful in the future when re-cable managing, but I'll take that as a my fault for being to rough I suppose. Just assumed in a $150+ case that important areas like that would be a bit stronger given how stiff PSU cables are from any given PSU supplier. Another con I feel the need to mention, albeit a small one, was completely mis-aligned magnets on the cases top dust filter. The magnets on one side are purposely offset as to allow radiator fan clearance among other great reasons, but mine for whatever reason was already peeling off and crooked... had to fix & make sure the adhesive re-stuck itself. Size may be a con to some, as this case is a big boy... definitely a full size ATX in every sense of the word. Last con I feel is worth mentioning as this may make or break what color a person chooses for their build (white or black case), keep in mind the black case does in fact come with a SMOKED glass side panel, unlike the white version of this case. It's not horrendously dark, if you have components with RGB on them you're 100% be able to see them, but nevertheless the side panel is for sure a darker, more smoked look when compared to the white version.\n\nAll in all I see this case lasting me many years to come, & with many different builds as time goes along. I highly recommend if you're looking for a standard ATX case that's capable of push tons & tons of airflow, while still having adequate space and dust filters.\n\n8.5/10 rating."

        "review": "Rating: 5/5\nPrice when purchased: £139.99\n\nPros:\n- Exceptional value for the price point.\n- Prompt and secure delivery with meticulous packaging, nestled in foam and safeguarded with transparent foil.\n- Significant enhancements over the 4000d airflow model, including a glass door feature and an adaptable internal layout. If your initial component arrangement isn't optimal, the flexible inner walls make adjustments a breeze.\n- Perfectly accommodates the MAG Z790 TOMAHAWK motherboard.\n- Inclusion of 2 fans and a fan controller enhances its value proposition.\n- Maintenance is straightforward with easily detachable nets ensuring cleanliness.\n\nCons:\n- Its weight (13.84kg / 30.51lbs) can be a drawback for those considering mobility. I initially contemplated transporting it from the EU to the UK but ultimately chose to purchase a second unit for the UK.\n\nI've always been partial to Corsair cases, having previously owned the 4000d airflow. Transitioning to the 5000d airflow feels like a significant upgrade. This model boasts an array of detachable compartments, increased easy-to-clean airflow nets, and the added functionality of a hinged glass door. The design is accommodating, allowing for greater ease when setting up, particularly when connecting cables and fans. Aesthetically, the case is a stunner—sleek and modern. It's refreshing to see such a refined design at this price point. My initial reservations about fitting the Z790 TOMAHAWK were put to rest—it integrates seamlessly."

        "review": "It took three tries, but I finally received a \"Corsair 5000D Airflow Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case - Black\" with no damage. First case was used (lower price) but missing many items, second case was new but came with a shattered glass panel. The third was perfect. I wanted to upgrade the review rating ASAP since this is an excellent case and deserves acknowledgement in that regard.\n\nI have it assembled with an Asus Rog Strix Z690 E, i9-12900KF, a MSI Suprim X 4090 Liquid GPU with a 240mm rad (top mount) and Arctic 360mm V2 rad for CPU (front mount) with front fans added to achieve push/pull. The PSU is a Seasonic Vertex GX-1200 (strong and quiet). It was a bit tricky but I was able to mount the video card in a normal orientation without inducing any severe bends in the GPU hoses, Consequently, a vertical GPU mounting was not needed.\n\nI was able to mount the CPU AIO with with hose end of the rad mounted at bottom. This helps as the air pockets form at the top of rad so with hose at bottom there is never gurgling and the pump never experiences startup cavitation (note pump is lower than that rad top, the highest point). This placement was simplified by (1) arranging the push/pull setup which moves the Arctic CPU rad backwards (a bit closer to CPU) and (2) the large cut out in PSU shroud that Corsair helpfully provides for this purpose.\n\nPositioning the CPU rad hoses at bottom allowed for easy installation of the Suprim 240 rad (pull fan orientation) and permitted a total of 3 fans at top. I removed the two noisy/ineffective stock MSI fans from the Suprim rad (I left the original MSI GPU card assembly fan). The system now uses 13 Arctic P12 PST fans which are inexpensive, quiet with excellent airflow. The 64GB of Corsair Vengeance 6600 ram is under a Corsair DIMM fan fixture that uses Noctua NF-A6x25 fans. The Arctic AIO includes a PWM VRM fan and the PSU fan is 135mm PWM. So 18 fans total all PWM.\n\nOne image shows the system running Cinebench R23 simultaneously with Fire Strike Extreme Stress. The total power draw is 850W which the Seasonic Vertex GX-1200 handles easily. Though there are 18 fans total, the Fan Xpert 4 software in combination with Nvidia bios runs the fans so that in this extreme condition they are relatively quiet. In normal gaming the fans are inaudible.\n\nI am not too keen on glass panels in general, so I ordered from Corsair a cable side panel to replace the board side glass panel (Corsair cleverly permits the side panels to interchange). I would have preferred that the board side panel be more fully perforated but it's not needed in this case which provides very adequate airflow. And yes, I paid $15 more to hide the system and the RGB lighting (which is all turned off anyway). The machine is for gaming, not gawking. If what I wanted was to see pretty colors under glass, I'd get a salt-water aquarium.\n\nI really don't understand the obsession with glass sides. Even if tempered, if the glass does break it will make a huge mess and will still offer risk to children/pets. A perforated steel cover would be more practical and certainly sturdier. It would allow just as much of the RGB vanity lighting to show through as would the dark glass panel. It should at least be an option.\n\nIn conclusion, I have learned that buying a used case is false economy. It might be fine to purchase other things used, but considering all the bits and pieces that go into a case, unless you can get a 50% markdown and can tolerate the inevitable missing parts, a new case is the best bet."

        "review": "This Case worked well with my setup, In total i was able to fit 10 noctua fans in this case (3 in front pulling, 3 on side pulling, 3 on top AIO exhausts , 1 out the Back exhaust) i was worried about the amount of heat in the case with my build, but this case does handle airflow well, the 3 side fans are able to pull fresh air into the case and there is a shroud to direct this air straight over the motherboard, while the 3 front fans are also pulling air in to help cool the GPU, i did top mount my AIO and setup my fans to exhaust air out of the case through the radiator, to prevent the system from pulling dust in. though there are really nice filters on the top front and side of the case. i just didnt want to worry as much about dust build up. my CPU stays nice and cool due to the amount of air moving through the case. GPU temps are fantastic. my only two complaints about this case is the fact that i had to slightly rotate my radiator to clear mobo power cables and the glass has a slight tent to it making it more difficult to admire the beauty of my build. other than that it was a dream to work with. Cable management was a breeze."

        "review": "This is probably the easiest case I've ever personally built in. Tons of options for airflow / fans / radiators (although not perfect, I'll explain later). The velcro cable ties are a nice touch, and they even throw in some extras in the accessories box which bodes well for cable management. Corsair includes some extra parts, like an optional bottom/front panel replacement if you need more space for things like front mounted radiator tubing. The only downside I found is the top fan / radiator mount. If you want to top mount a radiator and your motherboard has its CPU power pins at the top, you might run into trouble due to how close the radiator comes to the motherboard. I had to re-route my CPU EPS 12V cables around the radiator which was a slight hassle. Although it seems somewhat counter-intuitive, if you plan on top mounting a radiator I would advise putting the motherboard in first before mounting your rad. Aside from that, this case was really fun to work in."

        "review": "I have not built a computer since 2010 so I searched long and hard for months before I settled on parts. This is the case I chose do to price and features, it seemed to strike a great balance. The case comes well packed (maybe over packed, lots of waste) with clear instructions for taking it apart. It is easy to route cables with lots of room behind the MB and back panel. I built a micro-atx system and all parts fit easily. I only have two complaints, I guess with the old case you could remove the PSU shroud, but the one in my case is riveted in so it cannot be removed. Also the psu shroud is almost touching my video card (Asus 1660super) with only about 1/4inch gap between the gpu and psu shroud. The Asus 1660s is a \"double wide\" card, so if I had ordered my original gpu pick, a triple wide card, it would not have fit in the case without drilling out the rivets and removing the shroud. Something to be consider when selecting your case. The tempered class is nice and the blue LED stripe on the front is a nice touch (it can be turned off with a front panel button if you don't like it). The case comes with screws, MB set offs and zip ties. All in all happy with this case, and would probably still have purchased it even with the gpu/psu problem."

I almost bent my connectors; however, this can be avoided if you're careful.\n- The front dust filter is kinda useless. The holes are too big and dust is surely to enter your pc. It only filters a little bit of dust. There is no thin sheet of foam that serves as a filter. Other expensive cases has this feature. At the very least, since it has bigger holes, the airflow is fantastic. With that said, you might have to blow clean your pc with an electric duster every month."

        "review": "I want to like this case. It has good cable management, it's easy to work in, and it's a great price. I had no issues getting parts installed and the glass looks amazing, something you usually don't see at this price point. Unfortunately, there's 2 things that could be brushed off as minor inconveniences, but it's enough for me to knock off a star.\n\nFirst, the power indicator is red and the case light is blue. This was something I saw people talking about before I bought it, but since I was doing an anti-rgb build, I didn't care. But now that I have it, I hate the red button so much. Luckily, you can turn off the blue LED strip that runs along the front of the case. However, the red power LED is bright enough to ruin the look of a build, especially if you are going for a blue colored one. If you don't care that much about aesthetics, then it's not a major issue, but it is such an annoyance that I felt like bringing it up.\n\nSecond and MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, it is wayyyyy too easy to accidentally push the power button. It isnt as much of an issue if you have the PC sitting on top of your desk, but in my setup, I have it sitting on a shelf near the ground. I have accidentally kicked or bumped into the power button like 3 or 4 times now, and I'm not even that clumsy. Just getting in and out of my desk and grazing the button is enough to turn off the computer. I don't know why they decided to have the power button protruding from the case like it does. I have a feeling that it'll be just as easy to bump into it if it's on top of your desk. Reaching over to grab something like a mic or your phone or something can become a risk just because of the stupid button.\n\nAlso, no USB-C support? It's 2023, let's get at least one on the front panel. Won't knock a star off cause that's something you can see before you buy. But still I think Thermaltake can add one in the future\n\nI can't knock it too much tho. For the price point I really don't know if there's a better case out there. I'll eventually upgrade my build, and when I do, I will likely buy a new case to go with it. If you're working on a budget and want something gets the job done AND shows off your expensive parts, this is pretty darn good."

        "review": "This case is much smaller than a 10 year old case I was using. I happened to have a micro ATX motherboard that was 10 years old. The system was working fine. I also had a 2 year old power supply. The original power supply for the system failed 2 years ago.\n\nNew motherboards have a different layout. They allow SSDs that plug directly into the motherboard without needing SATA cables. This is a significant improvement. This case also allows installation of 2.5\" SSDs without too much trouble.\n\nThe challenging part is installation of 3.5\" hard drives. These drives are heavier. The system used by this case requires you to attach a rubber grommet into one of their enclosed mounting screws and then slide the drive into place. There is a keyhole shaped area on the metal chassis. If you do it correctly the drive drops into place. Just to ensure a really tight fit, I used zip ties to prevent 3.5\" drives from moving.\n\nFinally, you need a modular power supply for this case. SATA data connectors are no problem as long as you remember drives are mounted directly on the sheet metal. SATA power connectors can be challenging. Power supplies have daisy chained SATA power connectors. Since the drive is mounted directly on the sheet metal, you have part of the power cable going underneath the drive. You can avoid this problem by using SATA power connectors that are not daisy chained. Thermal difference using a smaller case is +5C. I'm now running the CPU at about 35C for the CPU and 34C for the motherboard. In a non-compact case with the same motherboard and a bulldozer AMD processor, the CPU runs at 30C and the motherboard temperature is 26C. The larger case has 4 fans inside. You can install additional fans at the front of the compact case but I didn't see any need to do this."

        "review": "This unit is great, it looks fabulous, it has excellent airflow it also has lots of lighted fans, however. If you have a regular ATX motherboard and you have or want to use a 280mm double or triple liquid cooler radiator you will not be able to fit them in the case together. after I installed my full ATX motherboard into this unit I then found that I could not fit my 280mm double3 fan radiator in the top of the case, the Ram dimms on the motherboard get in the way of the fan, and before you ask, the 280mm radiator does not fit in the forward position only on the top of the case, so I was forced to take my dremmel to cut slots in one of my Fan shrouds to allow room for the Dimms to fit when I installed the fans. This would definitely be a deal breaker for many out there, but I wasn't going to return the 280MM fans and radiator and pay more for the 240mm version, so I modified the fans to allow everything to fit. Other than this \"little\" problem the case is excellent and the design of the case is overall excellent. The wire routing can give you an extremely clean install with only a tiny bit of wires visible and the sculpted glass door on the left side is seriously cool and yes, it is Glass, not polycarbonate. the overall construction quality is excellent and is perfect for someone who is looking for a good quality case I have zero complaints about this case, with the exception of it saying it will fit a 280mm dual fan radiator as this is only technically true, but don't expect to fit your full size Motherboard afterwards. So my advice is that if you like this case and also want to use a dual fan radiator do not buy a 280mm unit, but buy the 240mm triple, double or single radiator. If you intend to install a single 280mm fan radiator I think that there should be enough room for it and the motherboard, but no double and a triple will not fit this case at all."

However, the front panel / fans hub is.. subpar. It's screwed into the inner wall of the case in a manner that it blocks one of the cable management aperture - meh. And the 'Reset' button.. does not seem to be connected anywhere from that hub. Probably it could be figured out, but I left it not working. Not that I care for a reset button, it's just that the whole item gives.. 'made in a garage' vibes :D\nOverall happy with the outcome, probably not much more to expect in its price range."

It's got style, it's got grace, and it's ready to slay your computer game.\n\nFirst off, the polygonal mesh front panel is like looking at a beautiful diamond.

The three 120mm ARGB fans are like little disco balls spinning in your tower, and the ARGB lighting system is like having your own personal rave party. It's so cool, you may just have to invite all your friends over just to show off.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the crystalline tempered glass. It's like looking into the crystal ball of your computer's future. You can see all the components working in harmony, and it's almost like they're putting on a show just for you.\n\nPlus, this bad boy can handle E-ATX up to 10.5\", which means you can have all the space you need to fit in your components like a game of Tetris. And with the mid-tower size, you won't have to worry about it taking up too much space in your room.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a case that's both functional and fun, look no further than the Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 Mesh White Airflow ATX Mid-Tower.

Il prodotto trasmette subito sensazioni di ottima qualità dovuta alla qualità costruttiva e materiali (ottimi) utilizzati. E' ben fatto, solido, robusto anche abbastanza pesante (secondo me una nota positiva quando si tratta di case per pc). Il case è spaziosissimo, entrano schede madri di ogni tipologia. Riesce ad ospitare sistemi di raffreddamento a liquido fino a 360 mm (ovvero il massimo che esiste al giorno d'oggi). Inoltre, è predisposto per ammettere sistemi di raffreddamento a liquido customizzati! Anche una 4090 è la benvenuta se avete in mente di farvi il pc fisso della vita. Il sistema di circolo dell'aria è ottimo, le ventole davanti preinstallate ARGB sono veloci, silenziose e colorate, fa più fresco nel mio pc che nel mio freezer. E' possibile installare ovviamente altre ventole. I pulsanti sono ben fatti, robusti, le porte usb sono molto \"strette\" (vi prego di lasciare stare doppi sensi ambigui). E' presente un comodo pulsante per cambiare gioco di luci delle ventole sul davanti poco fa menzionate. Il case offre in dotazione una centralina che permette alla vostra bellissima scheda madre di regolare velocità e luci di tutte le ventole che avete nel vostro pc (ne potete attaccare un casino). Ahimè, raccoglie un sacco di polvere, ma vabbè, cosa da tutti. A me faceva paura la lastra di vetro davanti, bella spessa, temperata, forte. E che dire più, per il mio utilizzo da gaming saltuario va più che bene, anzi è sprecato, ma anche se siete dei gamer incalliti, secondo me può fare al caso vostro, a meno che non siate dei modder estremi, forse dovete puntare più in alto. Ad ogni modo, per 100 euro, vale assolutamente la pena acquistarlo. Consigliatissimo!"

The only thing that I could suggest is the to vent needs to be about two or three centimeters higher from the board. I have a 120mm AIO and I had to move it to the processor end because the RAM end of the board is too close to the AIO and as a result, the AIO doesn't fit properly at that end. A 240mm wouldn't fit there and you'd have to put it in the front of the case, and then you'd have to relocate the front case fans. That's the only one change I can think of."

I love how easy it is to get the fans working, all you have to do is plug one power cable in and the fans start working, they can be controlled with the LED Button on the case which I prefer over some software. Airflow is good, my parts stay cool but that also might be because I have a Ryzen 5 1600. Size wise, it is a lot smaller then other cases that I have used in the past. I am using a Micro-ATX motherboard and it looks fantastic. There are also decent holes for cable managing.\nCons: I wasn't given any GPU Slot Screws so I had to use some from another build."

So of your desk size is small this will definitely fit into the space.\n\nColor: I got the white color but I did not like the white paint of the cabinet. It looked too average and a bit dull.\n\nSpace:\nDO NOT GET THIS CABINET IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO INSTALL A AIO or MATX/ATX motherboard.\nThe cabinet is too compact for a 240mm AIO radiator to fir. It was too much struggle to finally find a way to mount it.\nAlso when you install a MATX motherboard it hides the right side holes for putting motherboard cables. Its makes your wire management difficult as you have one single hole to bring out any wire.\n\nCable management:\nNo specific cable management tools are provided. You have to be good with the techniques of hiding wires.\n\nAlso the cabinet obstructs your GPU outlet hdmi slot. You will have to use flat cables so as to prevent HDMI cable loosing out of the cabinet.\n\nAir flow is also average.\nThe cabinet is good for a normal built with nothing much loaded on the motherboard."

        "review": "Ive built a lot of systems in Corsair, and NZXT cases, but this one is just incredible. Ample space for larger components (AIO, 40 series GPUs, larger PSUs), easy to work in, tons of room for cooling, sexiest glass design yet, awesome cable management options especially around the back side, and finally the ease of access to everything. You can get every panel off without using a tool. (Strong and sturdy peg and slide system that locks them in place and then uses a single thumb screw to tighten). Drive bays are on a removable and swingable door/panel on the backside, top and back fan areas have trays for easy installation, removal or cleaning. I loveeee the modularity. The best experience I've had building a PC, and great for making everything easily accessible in the future if you need to make adjustments, upgrades, or troubleshoot."

For the price when I purchased it I can’t complain, but it’s not worth over $200 imo especially when it only includes 3 fans and utilizes 3 out of the 6 ports on the RGB controller."

        "review": "Building a new PC over the past month, I first thought of Corsair for a case. But I was disappointed to find that neither Corsair - nor any other manufacturer - seems to be making full-size cases any more that have room for a proper optical (DVD-ROM) drive.\n\nThen I discovered Phanteks, a maker I'd never heard of before. Glad I did! Despite the weird nomenclature the Phanteks Enthoo Pro turns out to be a great PC case, with solid construction and all the features I wanted. Construction is solid steel - and I mean SOLID. This case weighs a ton, it's built like a tank. But it's cavernously roomy and extremely well thought-out.\n\nThere's a 200mm fan at the front and a 140mm one at the back, plus a mesh top for water cooling radiators. All vents have removable dust screens. There's a proper rack for disk drives, with three externally accessible bays for optical drives or things like fan controllers. Sections of the drive cage can be removed to allow for extra-long video cards. There are several separate mount locations for SSDs.\n\nIt's easy to build neatly in the Enthoo. The power supply, at the bottom of the case, gets its own removable metal covering. The back of the case ('behind' the motherboard) has a plethora of little Velcro tie-downs, making it easy to route wiring. I mounted a Corsair iCue H150i radiator at the top of the case, with three 120mm fans - no problem, all the screw holes fit perfectly, and there was oodles of room to spare. (Double check me on this, but I'm pretty sure I could have gone to four 140mm fans.) The plastic top and front of the case are easily removable, a huge help to accessibility.\n\nI put a big ASUS Rog Crosshair VIII Dark Hero motherboard in the case with absolutely no problem. Mounting an AMD CPU doesn't need it, but the case has a huge cut-out for rear access to Intel-style cooler mounts. Everything went together smoother than on any of my previous builds.\n\nThe front of the case has a built-in port panel, with USB and audio ports. A flip-up cover conceals this and keeps dust out when the ports aren't in use. I like the modest clear panel - I've got the Corsair lighting programmed to give me a reading on temperatures. However, one thing the Enthoo Pro lacks is venting for a side-mounted radiator.\n\nThere are lots of bonuses. The manual is good, with lots of diagrams. All the screws you'll need (and then some) are shipped in a nice plastic box with little compartments in it. This case is a class act all the way.\n\nOne caution: the newer Enthoo 2 adds a few nice features (such as room for a front-mounted radiator), but DROPS the optical-drive bays. If that matters to you, you might want to do as I did and snap up the original Enthoo Pro in a hurry. I don't think you'll regret it."

        "review": "I upgraded some pieces to my PC. New motherboard, RAM, CPU, etc. But found it didn't fit in my existing tower. I'm not into the fancy lighting so I was happy to find this one. Also, I still use my DVD drive for some old cd's with programs in them so I was glad this had it as well. Be prepared. When they say it's full size; it's full size. Quite a bit bigger than my old one but that made it super nice to work with. Lots of room for wires to fit. This has a rear compartment for wiring to hide and made everything super clean. Huge fan in the front and 120mm fan in the back moves lots of air for cooling. My new CPU cooler has 2 fans as well so I'm not worried about overheating at all. Vents have filters, which is nice. Good looking unit at a reasonable price. I'd buy again if I had to. Also, more mounts for future fans if needed or desired."

        "review": "I've purchased 3 of these over the past couple of years to make builds for myself and family members. Solid steel construction (very sturdy and heavy), no RGB nonsense to inflate the price, plenty of space for whatever you want to throw into it and space to rout your wires and allows for installation of optical drives (which is getting rarer every year and was one of the initial selling points that drew me to this case). The 2 included fans are fine (but I personally added 2 fans on the top grate for additional cooling, it really depends on how much heat the components you use generate). This is the best value for money case I have ever used and I would buy it again if I ever have to build a PC for someone else I know.\n\nInteresting to note, the first 2 Enthoo Pros I bought included: 2 USB 3.0 slots and 2 USB 2 slots on the front panel, but the 3rd one I bought included: 2 USB 3.0 slots and 1 USB C charging port (no USB 2 slots), I assume they changed the design of their front panel in the last year to modernize it. So keep this in mind when buying. Otherwise it was identical to the other 2 cases and of the same build quality.\n\nNo flashy/tacky nonsense that will look dated in 6 months, it just works, has a classic look and doesn't look like a piece of tacky trash that was dug out of Optimus Prime's chest cavity."

        "review": "Really good case for $100~\nCompares pretty well to some thermaltake cases I've had in the past; 2-3x the price.\nSteel parts are heavy, with few sharp edges inside.\nDrive Rack is just ok. Chassis is sturdy enough, but drive cages are flimsy (screwless plastic) and aren't suited well for 2.5\" SSDs. The side mount is better but too tight to the side panel making it difficult to route power and SATA Ribbons. MB mount plate had standoff holes in exactly the right places for my MSI board. Standoffs are black painted or chromed? I prefer bright brass standoffs in case one drops in the black case.\nPCI-e lines up well, and had plenty of room for a 3090 inside. There shouldn't be any trouble connecting large GPUs in this case.\n\nSide covers are easy to remove, and provide good access to internals. 2 finger screws hold each in place securely.\n\nIncluded fans were poorly centered, flimsy. I would have liked a version with no fans for a little less money.\nAll fans were replaced with Noctua industrial fans. It's large and vented on 4 sides; so good airflow is needed to avoid hotspots. No less than 5 high cfm fans recomended on an air cooled setup. This is not a quiet case, but far from the noisiest; it really depends on fan/hw selection quite a bit.\n\nFront covers, fan covers, external plastic parts feel solid/tight.\nPower button Is a big negative: It wobbles when pressed, colored the same (black) as the rest of the case, and a little too small. A silver or minimally backlit 1.5cm round button that doesnt wobble would have been nice.\n\nFront panel with extra ports/audio/restart button works well.\n\n-The case weighs a ton. It actually cracked the wood table I put it on! Feels like 90 pounds filled.\n\n-Came well packed for shipping\n\nI recommend it as a full sized, basic enclosure. Def no frills, but can't be expected for $100"

        "review": "Pros:\nBuilt solidly and has lots of space.\n\nIt also has bays for Bluray players which is getting rare, unfortunately. Three is excessive, but it is better than none at all.\n\nNo spastic annoying lighting. It is so ridiculous that cases are lit up like Xmas trees.\n\nIt comes with quite a few screws and whatnot. Most I didn't need but it is great for any future needs. It is also in a nice plastic tray with a solid lid and they are not all tossed into a bag.\n\nThe power button is in a very convenient place.\n\nThe mobo standoffs were already installed, which is nice. It is often a headache to put them in. It is just the standoffs needed for an ATX board that are installed but it comes with extras if you are putting in an E-ATX board.\n\nCons:\n\nThe glass side panel is a worthless thing That likely adds to the expense.\n\nThe manual says that it is supposed to have 2 SSD trays but it only shipped with one. I contacted them, and the timeliness and accuracy of their reply will move the rating up or down. Edit: I emailed them on a Sunday evening, and they responded Tuesday morning asking for my invoice - totally reasonable - and within an hour I got a notification that it was being shipped.\n\nThe SSD tray is clunky. It should not require screws. It is nearly impossible to solidly screw the SSD in with 4 screws. It is also difficult to squeeze the SATA power cables through the slot.\n\nThe no-tool 5.25\" bays do not work. It did not solidly clip my Bluray player in and required two screws.\n\nThe weird PWM controller is worthless and a potential point of catastrophic failure, and adds more to the cost. Losing the CPU fan to an untrustworthy addition is just asking for trouble. Luckily, it can be easily ignored and the fans plugged into the mobo like the nerd gods intended. It would have been better to ditch that and add an additional fan.\n\nThe reboot button is not in a convenient place.\n\nThe cover on the front USB ports is annoying.\n\n----\n\nIt is probably my fault, but even all of the features to manage cabling don't help much if you are like me and have multiple SATA drives. That is not a pro or con.\n\nOverall, there are no serious complaints and it feels like it will last a very long time."

        "review": "I've been looking for a case that will keep my components clean, yet still provide as much airflow as possible. Also, that wouldn't break the bank. After a lot of searching, I decided to give this one a try.\n\nI'd not heard of Phanteks before, but the price was considerably less than large cases by more well-known brands. I like to tinker with my case and swap parts in and out a lot, so the bigger the case the better.\n\nThis case is built well and is mostly metal. The frame and most panels are screwed on rather than riveted, so it's easy to take it apart when building in it. You can customize it to make room for liquid cooling if you want, or you can keep the optical drive bays installed if you still prefer using DVD and CD ROMs.\n\nI have two optical drives, two SATA 'traditional' hard drives and there's still room for a plug-in SSD drive in there. I do also have an SSD drive, but it is the new NVME style that plugs into the motherboard.\n\nThere is room for a full-sized ATX motherboard and you still have room for a three-fan graphics card. I currently have a one-fan graphics card installed myself because it used to be in much smaller case. If GPU prices stop being crazy someday, I might upgrade the GPU.\n\nThe fan situation is amazing. It comes with a 200mm fan in the front and a 140mm fan in the back. There's room for either 120 or 140mm fans in the top and bottom of the case that you can add later. The brackets in the top and bottom will hold both sizes of fans. The Phanteks website says that the top of the case will hold three 140mm fans. I have three 120mm fans in it now. The front of the case can be modified to hold two 120 or 140mm fans instead of the 200mm fan if you want. Neither of the fans that come with the case light up.\n\nIn the other side of the case, there is room for cable management. It's the first case that I've owned that has this as well as the fan in the bottom. It's nice to be able to access the back side of the motherboard and to route most of the cables back there, making the other side with the window look neater. There's also a fan hub back here in which you can plug up to five fans (more if you use cable splitters). Then, you plug one more wire from the sixth spot on the hub into the 'Pump' power fan connector on your motherboard. That way, all of your case fans are controlled by the same controller on the motherboard and work together without having to have fan wires all over the main bay of the case. One bad thing about this hub though is that it can be a little tricky to remove wires once you plug them in. I accidentally damaged one of the brackets in the hub while trying to remove the wire. I got the wire to stay in by taping over it with electrical tape though.\n\nThe bay where the hard drives go is in the other side of the case opposite the window, so it hides them and leaves more room in the main bay. Air from the front and top of the case still flows through here though, so they won't overheat. The little brackets that you screw the drives into are easy to work with. Much easier than the bays in my previous cases.\n\nAnother thing that is much easier to deal with in this case than in previous cases I've owned, is the front bezel. It, along with the top of the case, snaps on and off easily making cleaning much easier. This is important since one of the dirtiest parts of a case can be where the air gets sucked into it.\n\nSpeaking of dust, this case tries harder to keep dust out than other cases I've had. It has screens in the front bezel, top bezel, and the bottom of the case to catch most of the stuff that tries to get in. The screens are easy to wipe off when you remove them. The ones in the bottom are in pull-out trays, so you can clean them without having to lay the case on its side.\n\nThis is a big case, so be sure that you have plenty of room for it on your desk. Also be sure that your desk is sturdy because by the time you finish building in it, it will be quite heavy.\n\nOne little issue with it is that once I finished building it and started using it, I noticed that after I had removed the windowed side panel a couple of times, it started rattling when the fans were running full blast. I tried all sorts of things. Finally, putting a thin piece of foam that came with the computer case (probably to keep parts from rubbing together) under the middle leg on the left side. That seems to have solved it for now.\n\nSpeaking of the bottom and the legs, be sure when you are using the case, to not sit it on carpet, nor to block the bottom of the case with anything since it is one of the ways that fresh air gets in the case, especially after you install a fan in the bottom. When you put a fan in there, be sure to have the back side (or ugly side) of the fan motor showing inside the case so that the fan will draw air into the case rather than blowing it out.\n\nIt's by far the best case I've owned and for a great price too."

        "review": "I've built many (tower) personal computers, dating back to the first Intel 386 architecture. This is the nicest case I've worked with. It is large, and as such takes some effort to move around, and the feet are good... they prevent the unit from sliding around too much on a hard surfaced floor.\n\nThe case is wide enough that the bulk of any point-to-point wiring can be hidden behind the internal motherboard mounting plate, and there are lots of hook-loop straps attached on the back side to tie down the wiring very nicely. The motherboard mounted and everything lined up perfectly... from all the mounting holes to the rear panel connectors. The top is open enough to house a 3-fan liquid cooler radiator and fans, the case fan on the back (140mm) is mounted in slots so its height is adjustable to allow for such top mounted coolers. The front mounted 200mm case fan does a nice job blowing air over the 3.5\" HDD bays. There's room for 6 3.5\" drives, up to 3 5.25\" drives and a bracket for a 2.5\" SSD.\n\nWhat I found was that it's not easy to find tower cases with 5.25\" bays for things like DVD/BD readers/writers. This was a \"must have\" for me, as although I put gaming hardware in the box, I use it for some other intensive video rendering work.\n\nOnly a couple of (minor) negatives. The acrylic or polycarbonite \"windows\" in the side panel can be easily scratched... I suggest leaving the protective sheet on until you're finished with your build. I don't care for the lift-up door to access the front-panel connectors... you have to bend down to below the level of the little door to see the connectors.\n\nOverall, for the price, this is an excellent case for a \"business computer\" build. Plenty of room for the power supply, lots of drives, even ATXe motherboards and handles liquid cooling components nicely. If you're going to do a custom liquid cooler that has a reservoir, there's even a reservoir bracket that you can mount inside the case. I'd buy it again if I were to do another build-out."

        "review": "I liked building two computers using this white case. There are a lot of features packed into this compact case, which would also make it a good choice for someone building a computer for the first time. My main complaint is the panel that covers where the cables go around to the back almost always has to slide to the second position. I had to do this both times because there was no other way that my 24-pin cable could fit through the gap at such a sharp angle. Now the cables in the back are visible. Another thing to consider is that if you're using PSU cable extensions, a non-modular PSU, and RGB controllers, then that HDD bay probably won't fit. Quality is quite good overall. The only place where it falls short is the bracket that holds the three fans on the side is a bit flimsy. Anyways, bought twice and happy with it both times. Comes with plenty of screws, zip ties, and two 3-pin fans."

        "review": "Nice looking case and fits an ATX board perfectly, it was my first pc build and i wasnt too stressed figuring this case out, comes with the cables on the back already organized and managed. Temps only reach 68c with an overclock to 5ghz and with the 3060 running the case doesnt really get that loud at all, when idle its really hard to hear it, i can only slightly hear the sound of my AIO.\nDefinitly can reccomend this case, Not sure if it can fit 40 series cards though like the 4090 but it fits my MSI 3060 Gaming x gpu, i also built a second pc and it was easy to install a micro atx aswell.\nThe only con id say is the fact there is only 1 usb port at the front but that doesnt bother me since my rear IO has like 8 ports and my keyboard has USB passthrough.\nI recomend buying the one with the fans, the one without rgb fans isnt really my favourite since its only controlled via voltage since it is only a 3 pin. Also they could make more room to more comfortably install a commander core XT but i managed to stuff it in there at the back."

Voici ce que j'en pense en quelques points:\n\n----------- Design & Finitions :----------------\nLe boîtier offre une esthétique sobre et orientée Gamer, notamment avec le verre trempé qui permet d'exposer les composants internes du PC. C'est sans doute l'une des raisons principales pour lesquelles j'ai choisi ce modèle. Aussi il y a une version avec vitre avant ou avec grille, celle avec une grille a un meilleur airflow, mais j'ai investi sur un bon kit de refroidissement et j'ai pris le boitier avec une vitre avant car il est plus esthétique pour moi.\n\n------------- Éclairage RGB: ---------------\nLe système d'éclairage iCUE de CORSAIR ne déçoit jamais! J'ai pu personnaliser l'éclairage selon mes besoins et il est très facile à utiliser, et il se marie parfaitement avec le reste de mon setup.\n\n---------------Air Flow:-------------\nJ'utilise plusieurs ventilateurs et le boîtier est conçu pour permettre une circulation d'air optimale. Même pendant les sessions de jeu gourmandes, ce qui est un gros plus pour moi.\n\n--------------Espace & Modularité:-----------------------\nBien que qualifié de \"moyen tour\", le 4000X offre suffisamment d'espace pour tous mes composants, et j'apprécie vraiment sa modularité qui m'a permis de gérer facilement le cable management.\n\n------------Facilité d'installation: ---------------\nLe montage a été un jeu d'enfant. Tous les emplacements sont clairement identifiés et accessibles.\n\nCependant, rien n'est parfait. J'aurais aimé avoir peut-être quelques passages de câbles supplémentaires ou des options de personnalisation (quelques câbles restes bien visibles sur les photos), mais ce sont des détails mineurs au vu de la qualité générale de ce boîtier.\n\n---------------Conclusion :------------------\nJe recommande vivement le CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB à quiconque cherche un boîtier PC alliant esthétique, performance et qualité de construction. Je recommande vivement !"

        "review": "I recently upgraded my PC case to the CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB, and I must say, it's been a fantastic addition to my setup. Here's my unbiased review of this product.\n\nPros:\n\nStunning RGB Lighting: The RGB lighting on this case is a showstopper. The three included SP120 RGB Elite fans illuminate your PC with vibrant, customizable colors. The iCUE software allows you to sync the lighting with other Corsair peripherals, creating a visually cohesive gaming or work environment.\n\nExcellent Build Quality: The case feels solid and well-constructed. The tempered glass side panel provides a clear view of your components, and it's easy to remove for maintenance or upgrades.\n\nGreat Cable Management: Corsair has designed this case with cable management in mind. There are plenty of cable routing channels and tie-down points, helping you achieve a clean and organized interior.\n\nAirflow: Despite the emphasis on aesthetics, Corsair hasn't compromised on airflow. The front panel has a mesh design that allows for adequate ventilation, keeping your components cool even during demanding tasks.\n\nSpacious Interior: The 4000X offers ample space for ATX motherboards and high-end GPUs. It also supports multiple storage options, including SSD trays and HDD cages.\n\nEasy Installation: Installing components in this case is a breeze, thanks to the well-thought-out layout. The tool-free drive bays and PCIe slot covers make the build process smoother.\n\nCons:\n\nPrice: While the features and quality are top-notch, the price point may be a bit high for some users. However, considering the included RGB fans and overall build quality, it's a reasonable investment for enthusiasts.\n\nLimited Radiator Support: If you plan on using a large liquid cooling setup, the radiator support might be a bit limited, especially at the front. You'll need to ensure that your chosen components fit within the case's dimensions.\n\nIn summary, the CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case is an outstanding choice for gamers and PC enthusiasts who prioritize aesthetics without sacrificing functionality. It offers a stunning RGB lighting experience, excellent build quality, and efficient cable management. While it comes at a premium price, it's a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to showcase their PC components in style."

Avec ses ventilateurs avant RGB qui illuminent subtilement mon espace de jeu, il ajoute une touche esthétique incomparable à ma configuration. Mais ce n'est pas que de l'apparence ! Ce boîtier offre une expérience d'installation et de gestion de câbles exceptionnelle.\n\nL'un des points forts incontestables de ce boîtier est sa facilité d'installation des composants. Les emplacements parfaitement conçus permettent de monter les cartes graphiques, les disques durs et les alimentations sans aucun tracas. Même pour quelqu'un comme moi, qui n'est pas un expert en assemblage de PC, l'expérience a été fluide et sans embûches.\n\nLa gestion des câbles est un autre aspect remarquable. Grâce aux passages intelligemment placés, j'ai pu dissimuler habilement tous les câbles disgracieux, offrant ainsi un aspect soigné et bien organisé à l'intérieur du boîtier. Cette fonctionnalité s'est avérée essentielle pour maintenir une circulation d'air optimale et garder mon système au frais pendant de longues sessions de jeu intenses.\n\nLes vitres latérales et en façade ajoutent une touche de transparence qui met en valeur l'ensemble de ma configuration. C'est un plaisir de pouvoir admirer mes composants et de montrer fièrement mon travail d'assemblage. Corsair a vraiment pensé à tout pour offrir aux utilisateurs un spectacle visuel incroyable, à l'intérieur comme à l'extérieur du boîtier.\n\nMais ce n'est pas seulement une question d'apparence. La qualité de construction du boîtier est exceptionnelle. Les matériaux robustes utilisés inspirent confiance et je sais que mes composants sont entre de bonnes mains. Le boîtier offre également une excellente isolation phonique, ce qui réduit considérablement le bruit de fonctionnement de mes composants, offrant ainsi une expérience de jeu plus immersive et agréable.\n\nEn résumé, le boîtier PC Corsair avec RGB et vitres latérales est un véritable bijou de technologie et de style. Il allie parfaitement le design moderne avec des fonctionnalités pratiques, comme une installation facile des composants et une gestion de câbles ingénieuse. Les vitres ajoutent une touche visuelle impressionnante, tandis que la qualité de construction assure une durabilité à toute épreuve. Si vous cherchez à donner un coup de boost à votre setup gaming tout en restant fidèle à la qualité, ce boîtier est un choix incontournable. Corsair a vraiment frappé fort avec ce modèle, et je ne peux que le recommander à tous les passionnés de PC qui veulent un boîtier à la hauteur de leurs attentes les plus élevées."

My old case wasn't awful, but it began to fall apart, and I always wanted a white PC case so I decided to give in and get this one! I don't regret it at all so far. It was really easy to set up, and the cable management is way better than other cases I have worked with (I have worked on a few PC's for my brother and friends as well). I also love how this case is a mid sized tower, but somehow has so much room? I found it much easier to work with compared to my old case, which was a large sized tower. Everything is really easy to remove and put back together, and it came with extra zip ties, velcro strips, and screws for fans and screwing in the motherboard, which is super nice. The only thing that I noticed was it doesn't fit a 140mm fan at the back of the case, which is what I had in my old case (this is user error, I didn't double check this. Just wanted to mention in case anyone might be unaware too). But the case came with two simple black 120 mm fans so I just used one of those no problem. It looks great and I am super happy with it!"

        "review": "Just upgraded to the GT501 from my old Chaser mk1 that was just showing its age. This thing is just amazing from the textured paint to the LAV III like angles and shes nice and roomy. It was a pleasure to build in and the lighting comes through the front way better then expected. The only minor issue is that its straight RGB not ARGB but if your like me thats not really a fault as this case isn't really made for rainbow effects, this is a TUF case so mean red, cold blue or caution yellow are more suited, I did go a purple/aqua for fun and it seemed to work with my 3070s rgb better (still deciding). Also a point to note is ASUS on their own site fails to tell you that this case does support a 280mm top mounted AIO/RAD and has mounts for a full water build. This was only found by myself when really researching and viewing the support PDF for the case. This was a pleasant surprise as it lets you keep the 120 fans up front as a 280 up front just wont work, also there's enuff room for a push/pull setup up top for your 280 or 360mm rad. I currently have a Kraken X63 but you could also put the arctic liquid freezer II with its thick rad as a push/pull up top as well... tons on space in this, amazing for a mid case. Only complaint as of now is you only have 2 slots for a side mount gpu so the thick 3070/3080/3090s are stuck in a standard format. The pic shows a evga 3070 ultra gaming ftw and its a 3 slot just for reference, really from a cooling stand point side mount is more show then function so I'm not to upset."

I am not using the fans that came with the PC, so those you are seeing are EZDIY-FAB 120mm fans, 2 different types which I set the colours to match the ASUS TUF theme going on. The glass side panel is such a great design, having captive screws and mounts on the bottom that hold it in place even after undoing the screws, no worries at all of it falling and breaking. The mesh over the top fans and front panel have so far really helped keep the inside clean, and the handles on the top make moving this beast of a case around really easy, and I love this about the case. I did have to reorientation my GPU as the vertical mounting was fine for a bit, but as Summer came along, the warmer temps inside have really hampered the GPU cooling as the GPU sits really close to the glass. I would move that mount back as far as possible to the other PCI ports if I had to change anything. The back panel has lots of room for cable management and has the same captive screws, all around this case is really nice and would recommend if the price drops to a reasonable price, around $200 CAD"

I also feared tempered glass breaking in the move, so I thought downsizing to MATX was the best way to go.\n\nGot this case because of the various storage/ fan configs you can plan, and for the ATX PSU support. My Corsair 850W PSU did fit even though it's a touch long, but I'm able to install it in the middle slot position while still being able to install both an SSD AND have plenty of cable clearance for my cables both on the bottom while having plenty of space above to run the extension cable from my power supply to the back of my case.\n\nThis case is roomier than I expected, and my commander Pro stuck to the PSU cage without extra tape or anything (though it has to be in a certain spot so it doesn't fall).\n\nWhile there is SOME cable managenent behind the motherboard tray, there's not quite as much as I'd like, however, mounting the power supply in the front helps. There's also a small removable should that helps block the PSU and most cables from view from the side. There's also a collum on the other side of the case that hides some of the other cables well too.\n\nThis case can really breathe but only has one fan filter on the bottom. I had to get some magnetic DIY fan filters for the sides to help reduce dust, but it is getting more dusty that my old build, but it's fine since I dust regularly. The mesh it comes with dies diffuse the RGB well and it looks cool.\n\nThe frame is also completely toolless, except for the one cable shroud near the power supply. But taking off the sides, top or front of the case is fast, easy and painless, only requiring a good grip and some light force.\n\nThe only complaints I have is that their USB C header is useless to me currently because the Asus board I have only has a USB 3.0 and 2 regular USB headers which are occupied by my commander Pro and my AIO. I could split one port but I don't want extra splitters kicking around in there or adapters and splitters just to use a USB slot that I don't have anything to use with anyway. The power button is also BRIGHT at night and flashes in sleep mode. It grew so annoying while I was trying to sleep that I immediately unplugged the power LED.\n\nCurrently ASUS is having controversies with the quality of some of their products, but for now, their case seems solid and my be the only recent Asus product that I'm satisfied with and trust. If this doesn't bother you, then this is a good choice for an MATX build."

Also it’s not really silent. I recommend this case, it’s great for the price."

        "review": "I'm very happy with this case.\n\nPros:\n- Front, top, side panels and the bottom filter all can be removed for easy access to internal components. The panels use captive bead style locking and don't require tools to (dis)assemble.\n- Mesh on all sides for good air flow.\n- Enough space to easily route all the cables.\n- Fits standard size GPU, PSU and fans.\n- Space for multiple 2.5\" drives.\n\nCons:\n- Unclear PSU mounting instructions. The PSU is mounted up front and I mounted mine with the intake fan facing to the front and the exhaust facing to the top of the case. The manual doesn't show which way to mount the PSU and the 90deg angled power cable extension seems to suggest mounting PSUs with the intake fan facing the inside of the case (my power cable extension is 90deg angled to the front and then does a 180 and goes all the way to the back of the case). Make sure to mount the PSU with the fan facing outside for better airflow.\n- While 3 2.5\" drives can be mounted in the case there is only one cradle. The other 2 are screwed directly to the case. My SATA power cable doesn't fit if the drive is mounted flush with the case in the non-cradle spot. I was able to mount the drive at a bit of an angle with only 2 screws on the back/non-connector side. Not ideal but the drive does feel securely mounted.\n- With my graphics card there is around 0.5in of space between the bottom case fans and the graphics card and the card covers the fans almost entirely. This does not inspire confidence in the 2 bottom fans being able to effectively deliver air to other components.\n- No space for a front intake fan.\n- With 3 top fans mounted the power switch on my PSU wouldn't be accessible. I mounted 2 fans on the bottom, 1 on the back and 2 up top leaving 1 top space empty.\n- Top panel has to be removed to access the PSU power switch."

Specs say only two 120mm fans fit on the bottom, there are only screw holes for two 120mm fans but if you get fans that connect to each other like lian li Uni fans you can put three 120mm fans on the bottom no problem. I replaced the included rear 120 with another lian li Uni fan and set it as intake with a magnetic dust filter on the outside. I thought I’d save room by using an sfx power supply but the frame that holds the power supply is larger so I don’t gain any video card clearance (not even needed with founders edition cards) with the smaller psu, sfx cables are tight, had to use a cpu power extension cable. I’m using the middle mount for the psu, and the included internal ac power extension pressed into the fan frame on the aio, it tweaked things a bit and couldn’t use all of the screws to mount the radiator. I decided to get a slim right angle extension from MODDIY part# C0507. Wish these were available on Amazon as it took a couple weeks to ship from China. With this cable installed I’m pretty sure I could move the psu bracket to the top position if I replace the radiator fan with a slim 120 to get full gpu clearance if I ever need it."

        "review": " First of all, it's a great looking case. The build is solid and doesn't feel cheap. That being said, I do find some faults, that admittedly, I should've done more research. The 3 panes of glass have gaps between them and other larger vents/holes throughout. There's a massive amount of space from the viewing side, but for a dual chamber, you're limited due to rear removal drive bays taking up needed space. You can leave the drive trays out, but the covers are integrated, leaving more gaping holes. You can't use the \"basement\" if you're using bottom fans. BUT all the fan mounts have non-removable restrictive filters (unless you want to leave off the panel they are connected to). My guess is that you're supposed to point all the fans inward to counterbalance the mesh restriction and create enough positive pressure to vent out all the cracks. Other cases I've built in this price range (Corsair, Lian Li, Fractal) have put more detail into the build. Really interested in seeing if Montech's King 95 will solve these issues at a much lower price point."

I converted the set up from liquid cooling to air cooling and have yet to thermal throttle in synthetic tests or extended gaming. CPU is never above 75* while gaming, GPU floats around 70*-90* depending on the game. If you are building a similar system, stick fans in it in a positive pressure configuration that doesn’t clash and you’ll be set.\n\nPaint and finish is surprisingly good. No chipped paint, no smeary scratches, no wear marks that I didn’t put on the case by accident. Oops. I went with the Snow White (white interior & exterior) and I never noticed any glaring build or quality issues.\n\nThere’s plenty of space inside to do a custom water loop. DOUBLE CHECK that any fat radiator you have will fit!\n\nAbsolutely tons of tie down areas. If you want to cable tie cables, there’s a spot in a well thought out location to do so.\n\nAesthetics are great, but that’s 100% subjective and honestly doesn’t matter toooo much.\n\nCons: Mostly small and things out of company control. Mine lightly was damaged. Those small quick clips that secure glass and plastic panels were broken on one of the glass panels. I don’t think it was manufacturing but was due to shipping. The case is shipped with all glass installed, so maybe in shipping all the jostling broke those plastic clips? Maybe the company can figure out a different way to ship with the glass side panel off.\n\nSome of the case screws are really tight. They paint the screw threads themselves, and combined with the painted case makes very tight screws. Threading & unthreading strips the paint off the screw threads, which is normal. But kinda annoying when you can just paint the screw heads to avoid all of it.\n\nThe instructions don’t include how to take off the PCIE riser cable to upgrade it, if you can even do that. It’s a PCIE 4.0 according to manufacturer, so when I upgrade GPU I will need to upgrade that. I’d like to not go in blind and undo all the screws and possible mess something up. Please update the manual."

Added heat pipes, denser radiator. The best fans. All make this one of the best air coolers available.\nIf you want specifics. I switched from a 240 AIO top mounted in a Meshify C case with 5 Arctic p12 fans. This cooler dropped my temp during stress tests 10-15 degrees on CPU max temp. From 76 down to 62. Amazing results in apples to apples comparison. And no imperial noise data. Just to say that my noctua set up much quieter than AIO with better performance. My graphics card temps went up 2-3. Which is. It ideal, but we’ll worth the trade off. I’ll just play with my fan curve.\nI’m not sure I’ll ever go back to AIOs. People that say air coolers don’t look nice have not seen a nice one. I am converted.\n\nUnfortunately my product arrived damaged. Please see pictures. No idea how this happened unless it was opened up prior to me receiving it. Package looked new and sealed. I understand things happen, but when I spend almost 200 dollars on a cpu cooler, I expect it to be mint.

Does a great job cooling an r5 3600 idling in high 30s to low 40s. In cinebench r23 max temp 74 degrees and while gaming up to 78 degrees max spike. I know the 3600 is not hard to cool. The U12A gives slightly better cooling performance than the wraith prism. About 4-6 degrees delta but it's much better at being silent. At 100% max fan spin, while audible it is not very loud. I've also used this cooler with a 5900x in the same case and that CPU is a hot one! It can cool the 5900x in cinebench r23 at high 70s to mid 80s and idle at around 45-50 degrees. While gaming I saw the 5900x temps spike really high. CPU package up to 89 degrees and CCD1 go up to 93. That being said the U12A chromax black is still a great cooler that I can easily recommend. If your case is limited to 158mm cooler height and you're thinking about purchasing this... do it, you won't regret it."

I am not worried that this would bend the board and break off during movement either. It feels much more stable because of its size. I think most people should skip D15/D15s and buy this instead. The installation is also easier. I also had a chance to try Scythe Fuma 2 Rev B which cost almost half as much. It is similar in size and performs well but not good enough for 12700K imo. It was definitely running hotter during benchmarks. But if you want to save on cost, I would recommend that, not D15S. This is not twice as good as Fuma 2 overall, more like 20% better. Overall I think the heatsink itself is not anything special, it's the 2x NF-A12x25s that make it work. I think if you buy two of those and put them on a cheaper tower cooler, it would perform similarly. Most of the money here is going to those two fans."

        "review": "This review is for Noctua NH-U12A chromax.Black, 120mm Single-Tower CPU Cooler (Black).\n\nWhen I finished putting my new build together, the wraith prism ended up being insufficient for the amount of heat the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X creates. I was seeing temperatures of around 83c to 87c (181.4F to 188.6F) whenever I turned on any game. Turn on a web browser and it would go up to around 76c (168.8F) in a room that's around 21c (69.8F) typically. At the time that I am writing this, I have BDO (Black Desert Online) running in the background, multiple browser tabs and Discord running - my CPU temperature is sitting around 68c to 74c (154.4F to 165.2F). That is a major difference in temperature from the Wraith Prism, especially since these newer CPUs are generally known to run hot. In terms of my case fan setup, I have three in front for intake, one at the back and two at the top for exhaust.\n\nI know the aesthetic might not be the best looking for everyone since some people absolutely love fan halos - I assume you might be able to buy fan halos to put on it and fix that issue, however - my RAM has RGB lighting which projects nicely on the intake fan so it creates this kind of very light, pastel look to it. If you go for the classic brown Noctua, there are some incredibly clean and aesthetically pleasing builds I've seen using them that I would advise looking up if your worry isn't only functionality but aesthetic.\n\nIn terms of noise level - I have very sensitive ears and I don't hear anything from it - the fan noise I do hear is from my case fans instead, which aren't Noctua brand, they're some rather generic fans that came with this case.\n\nIn terms of installation - it was incredibly smooth. I went with U12A because of the amount of clearance my computer has for the tower and my intake fan had to be lifted a little due to where the RAM sits which is perfectly fine to do. The fans have little clips that just clip onto and hug the radiator so they are extremely easy to adjust if needed.\n\nMy advice for anyone considering a Noctua brand air cooler:\n\n• Know the TDP of your CPU, it might be overkill for something with 65W for example but if you are looking to upgrade your CPU its a really good deal. How you use your computer is also a contributing factor to the amount of heat output - so do your research depending on how intense or complex the work you plan to do is, it could pull a lot more power and thus generate a lot more heat and maybe air cooling isn't enough to keep up with the heat output.\n\n• Consider things like the average temperature of the room you do or will have the computer in, your build layout, the case size, case air flow, and the type of case fans you are using and/or plan to use.\n\n• Compatibility & Clearance. You are able to check via Noctua's website if their coolers are compatible with your Motherboard, Case (not all cases are listed, but they have a formula to help you figure it out if need be), CPU, and RAM.\n\n• Make sure you triple check your information on clearance to make sure you buy the appropriate Noctua to suit your needs.\n\nTo whoever buys a Noctua brand cooler, enjoy! They come with a 6 year warranty too - which makes it feel like a better and safer product to purchase considering most computer components will generally start to have issues between 3 to 5 years down the line, and in the case of just so happening to get a faulty unit. As a consumer I know how daunting it could be when you are in the market for computer components given the amount of choices we have - and when you see a product with x amount of awards and good reviews it really makes you think about if it really is good - especially considering certain companies just buy good reviews. I typically never leave reviews because I also am one of the consumers that prefers to do my own research instead of just trusting and hoping that the product reviews are indeed legitimate. However, I am thoroughly pleased with this product and hope by leaving a review I can help anyone who cares for informative reviews and is like me; Prefers air cooling and has gotten a CPU that for the first time just any cooler isn't good enough for gaming.\n\nThis is my first Noctua brand CPU cooler, but the second one I've purchased. The first one I purchased was a NH-D15 for a family member's build, he however has a full tower, so he has a lot more clearance to work with than I do with my mid tower and it works like a charm for him as well. However, in his case he had swapped from an AIO that was dead/dying - so I'm sure he would have seen a difference in his temperatures regardless of what he got as long as it wasn't defective."

Running a Ryzen 7 5700g, and upgrading from a coolermaster A17C (similar to stock), that idled/performed at 72/85c.\n\nThe NH-U12A is currently idling/performing at 36/53c!\n\nWith auto-overclocking pushing the processor past 4ghz, that is a monumental improvement, and far greater that I had ever dreamed I would get for the price. This is a small case sharing space with a 3090ti, 2xNvme, 2xSSD, and 2xHDD; so it already has it's challenges, but even my PWM case fans are running 20-30% slower than before. Mobo and GPU temps dropped by 1-2c as result of lower ambient and probably better airflow in the case, overall.\n\nThe install used my existing AMD backplate, and the tower is offset to one side to allow for RAM clearance. I am running a micro-atx board in a somewhat cramped mid-tower case, and I was still able to install and work the fans in place fairly easily. Judging by the cramped conditions of my board, I would vouch for 100% universal RAM clearance, as the offset tower just does what it says it does; and the included fans are not thin by any means. As a bonus, the fans seem to be positioned just perfectly to draw intake air across the RAM an works well with my VR heatsink on the exit side of things.\n\nThe included fans are smooth as glass, and surprisingly quiet at full speed; but I had to manually run them to full, as the CPU wouldn't heat past 53c (Fan RPM 1300'ish). Primo fans, no RGB, but that's what I wanted for this rig. The wires are well sheathed in tubing and heatshrink- wire management approved.\nIf you've never dealt with this type of fan clip system, practice with them before you install the cooler. lol.\n\nI bought the add-on, decorative cover NA-HC7, which looks amazing on the installed cooler, and requires less effort to install than removing the side panel to get to it. This add-on should be RGB, as the cutout design is just too perfect not to be backlit. This kit did add height to the cooler, and my case is fairly small, but the glass panel clears everything by about 2mm.\n\nEverything came professionally boxed, shiny, and new; and you can just feel the care and quality in everything you touch, even the packaging.\n\nI rarely write reviews, and I am rarely impressed; but I was on the fence for weeks about a cooling solution on this particular rig, and I wanted to ensure others in my position can absolutely trust this cooler.\n\nEven versus watercooling, maybe. Dang."

Not ideal for me coming from water cooling but not dangerous and in safe limits. The thing I didn’t like about it most was my 4090 couldn’t be vertical mounted with this air cooler. For some that’s okay but for me it raises my ram temps by 15 degrees c in games being the back plate is right under the ram and heat rises right onto the ram sticks and also my 2 of my 4 nvme drives went up over 10 degrees c average being the 4090 dumps it heat on the motherboard nvme 1 and 2 slot with it mounted in the pcie slot. Then my 4090 mem temps raised 15c also not being vertically mounted. Seems wild but if you have a 4090 try it. Might surprised with the results. But it raised my whole system temps up and had to adjust my fan curve to the point it was unbearable to me. So I went with a Corsair aio again and all my temps dropped again. Cpu is easily under controlled on water. Which is expected. But using this now with my wife’s system 10700k at 5.1ghz on all 8 cores to replace my old cryorig h7 lumi that was struggling at 5.1ghz. Easily keeps the 10700k in check with no problems. Plus looks so good doing so. I love air cooling but didn’t want to buy a bigger new case to vertically mount my gpu with a air cooler to keep other components cooler."

The hard drive cage has two positions or can be removed entirely by 2 screws to fit a longer PSU if needed. Plenty of holes for wire management and a nice sized wire area behind the back panel. The glass panel came with plastic peel on both sides of the panel, which doesn't seem to be common but is a nice touch. Doesn't have rubber grommets around the wire holes but that is ok for the price, you could go up 30-40$ in case tiers to get those if they are important to you. Remember to remove the PCIe slot covers you will need open from the case before inserting the motherboard.\n\nThe case is visually nice as well, the white and black design looks good with a variety of component colors on the inside, you should be able to match almost anything with it.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the case did not come with a little screw bit to help put the motherboard stand offs in. Personally this does not matter to me as I have them already and other screw bits in my set. But for someone missing it, it does make inserting the standoffs straight a bit more difficult, Although it can be done by hand if needed, it will just be a bit more frustrating to do.\n\nA decent case."

The fans and front panel connectors were easy to set up, and it's overall just a pretty good case."

It is very light but sturdy, cable management is awesome, first pc that I was able to create a show quality PC with no effort, everything is slotted and tabbed in the absolute perfect spot for an atx case. The fans are super quiet and the rgb fans are just amazing! Super stylish for an amazing price!\n\nI was jealous, and decided to purchace a case for myself and when I received the case, the side panel was badly damaged from delivery. I sent Musetex a message thru amazon explaining the situation and they responded within a few hours and said they would replace the side panel no problem. The very next day they sent me a complete replacement case!\nOutstanding customer care!\n\nIn general, the case is rubust yet light, equipment runs very cool, fans have yet to ramp up at all under load, very sleek case for the price!\nOnly issue I had upgrading one PC running a Noctua nh-u14s fan was the door barely closed and would sometimes pop open due to fan height. I upgraded to a closed loop aio water cooler that was cheaper than the fan and the entire pc runs even cooler yet! (water cooler is the only way to go now these days, and looks 10x cleaner, and runs cooler)\n\nSo glad I didnt spend 2x the price on one of the other \"popular\" brands! - Customer for life! Thank You Musetex!"

It makes going in and out of the PC for adjustments and changes an absolute breeze and you can show off all of your beautiful parts. The case also does very well for cable management. ARGB fans look awesome; overall I’m very pleased with the finished product. One thing to note because it took me a while to get it all figured out myself; the case description does note that your motherboard needs a 5V ARGB (3pin) connection. You’ll actually need two because the front fans and the rear/top fans connect via 2 separate 3pin connectors. My motherboard instead uses a 4pin connection so technically I actually wasn’t able to light my fans at first. After adding a 3pin to 4pin converter and adding a splitter to connect both fans, I got it working perfectly. Hope this helps anyone."

        "review": "So the case was originally listed to come with 10 RGB fans, which is one of the reasons I bought it. They changed the description after I bought it and after I read one other review that said it didn't actually come with them. This isn't a big deal to me, I really liked the design of the case and was going to buy Corsair fans anyway, just like that I didn't have to right away while building my NEW PC(one less starting cost). the case does seem that it will have REALLY good air flow once, max 240mm AIO on the back does kind of suck, but you can run a 360mm on top and bottom, which is what I am doing anyways. Cable management to the motherboard isn't the best. There's 2 slots at the bottom of the case one isn't big enough to route the USB plug through at all and the other is further back and the only one at the bottom that you can actually fit the USB plug in and it makes it harder to do clean cable management. I like the power button on it. Downfall is that it only has 1 USB slot and 1 type-c slot on the case. So hopefully your motherboard has more than you needed. SATA and HDD mounts in the back of the case right under where the PSU is, you can take that out and it does help with routing any cables you need to if you put the mother board in 1st(I STRONGLY SUGGEST ROUTING ANY CABLES PRIOR, MAKES IT EASIER. I DIDN'T!!). Dust covers aren't really that great, they're not a fine mesh the holes are slightly large for a dust cover. One of the things I do like about this case is that I want to put a 5\" monitor screen in it to show temps of everything and with the number of fans that you can actually put in this case. It frees up the rear fan spot to do that with it.\n\nSo overall, If you have want a decent, buy it. If you don't want to buy a lot of fans that don't come with the case, don't buy it. I'm still happy with my purchase as of right now. I haven't finished building my new PC as of yet though and still might change my mind about keeping this case, as I REALLY like the Hyte Y60 and almost bought it instead because it has the vertical GPU mounting ability that this one doesn't.\n\nEDIT: I have to add on that taking the glass off the case is a slight pain. I like the fact that it's a tight fit but while you're building and you put t he glass back on to cover everything up, doing upgrades or just cleaning, it's slightly harder to take the glass off to do so."

Twin 140mm fans in the front also look great when lit up with ARGB. The side panel definitely is tinted so your computer innards aren't TOO visible, but ARGB definitely shines through.\n\nIt was a pleasure to build in with the nice removable tray for the front fans and has plenty of room on the back side to hide all of the shameful wires. It looks great and the angled GPU fan light shines through the bottom of the case which gives a nice \"underglow\" look in the evening.\n\nI utilize Fan Control and have custom curves for all of my fans. When web browsing I am able to keep all fans at their minimum speed of ~6XX rpm to keep things quiet and the CPU stays around 30-35C. I never see 100% fan speed on my curves and the temps stay around 70C even with 100% CPU load over an extended time."

        "review": "Got this case for a small upgrade which ended up turning in to a whole build.\nOverall the looks nice with good rgb, dust filters, tempered glass side panel etc. Building in it wasn't really an issue other than trying to fit some thicker flat cables and bending them just right to fit.\nThe main issue is airflow isn't amazing, thay cool tinted front panel restricts a lot of flow, there is a an airflow version with mesh there instead though.\nThe built in fan controller is also a bit odd. Proprietary 6 pin fan headers means you're stuck with it unless you replace the fans on the front, and there is no speed control at all on them. They can sync with your board for rgb however which is nice.\n\nOther than that some budget cut areas are thinner metal, the pci plates are snap out so can't be put back in. If you understand this and why the case costs as little as it does, it's pretty good for what you get."

By far my favourite part, however which is above and beyond my expectations was the way the fans and RGB are layed out. All of the connectors were already plugged into a microcontroller, leaving my motherboard free from unnecessary cables and leaving space for more fan slots. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised after seeing that. So far, I love the case."

This case offers a perfect blend of style, functionality, and affordability.\n\nFirst and foremost, the design of the V250 is simply stunning. The tempered glass side panel allows you to showcase your build with pride, and the RGB lighting options provide a customizable and eye-catching aesthetic. It's a real head-turner."

        "review": "The case came with a solid platic plate in front of the 3 fans. I found the same case online with a mesh screen. When I found this out, I contacted Thermaltake to see if I could order the screen, and they said they didn't sell the screen by itself (why not?) and that I would have to return the case and order the one with the mesh. Why the heck don't they just sell all with mesh? Airflow is king here - why wouldn't they do this in the first place? Not very good customer service for a part that probably costs $3. Other than this, the structure of the case is fine and had no other issues.\nI ordered this and used with a brand new AMD system (Ryzen 7900 cpu, ASUS creator mb). The front fans come with something like a 6 pin connector. This plugs into their fan controller. I connected the controller to the motherboard and 1) couldn't control the RGB with the MB and 2) couldn't control the fan speed. The fans did turn on and rotated at a constant speed. There was a manual control for the fans that you could connect to the reset button, which worked to control the RGB but only to one of their preset colors - and it was manual control.\nThe issue was that when the cpu/gpu heated up, the system couldn't ramp up the fan speed on the front fans to provide more cool air. I ended up replacing the 4 fans that came with the system with ones that were quieter and provided more CFM. I also suggest using dual 140mm on the top. I replace them with:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SZBJ5JZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BXC854Y3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HJPHJMH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PYPQ8SB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1"

Comes with front 3 ARGB fans and rear non rgb fan with controller. Customizable lighting effects with RGB Motherborad software or the built in button on the case near power button. Front mesh panel provides enough cool airflow into the cabinet while maintaining the beauty of RGB. PSU shroud has honeycomb structure ventilation which provides both airflow and rgb effects of psu. Right panel side has got enough space to manage all those messy cable is one more pros. Side tempered glass comes with 4 screws. I wish it would have been hinge mechanism for quick opening. Thats the one con I came across. But worth purchase. Has got everything to be gaming RGB cabinet under 5.5K"

The case fan is a standard 3 pin 5V fan. Mixed and matched fans. So I had to replace some fans in the case as I purchased ARGB cooler and ARGB extra fans for more cooling. My extra ARGB fans went to replace RGB fans in the front.\n\nBox was torn and crushed on the corners, but everything inside was okay."

        "review": " This was my first attempt to make a really beautiful RGB PC and I'm thrilled with the result. My version was the V250 with 3 pre-installed ARGB fans in the front. I bought 3 additional matching Thermaltake ARGB fans and installed one in the rear and two on my top mounted radiator.\n\nThe real gotcha is trying to figure out the pre-installed fans and how to integrate their hardwired fan control hub with motherboard control. The documentation is criminally poor, so it took a lot of guesswork to get everything flowing the way I wanted.\n\nTo make a long story not quite as long, here's what to do: The control hub comes connected to the case reset switch. You need to power up the PC and hit that reset switch for a few seconds, until the front fans flash. This confirms that the control hub is now set to motherboard control instead of case control. You can now safely remove the reset switch wire from the hub and plug it into the reset switch header on your motherboard. The case reset switch will now function as God intended. Now, the tricky part. You'll need to (for a MSI JRAINBOW motherboard header anyway) connect the 3 prong 5V ARGB cord into both the motherboard and the case fan control hub. In my case, connecting to the motherboard header was no problem, but on the other end, the male plug would absolutely not fit into the receptacle on the hub. I took a risk and shaved off the plastic left and right edges of the cord plug and jammed what was left in the socket on the control hub. I plugged SATA power into the hub as well. Half expecting my rig to burst into flames when I powered on, I was pleasantly surprised that I could now see and control the front case fans in Windows via Mystic Light motherboard control. I have to admit, it's some really bad quality control for the ARGB control socket on that fan hub to be so small as to be unusable.\nA user shouldn't have to shave a plastic plug down to the bare metal wire for it to fit where it's intended to go.\nAnyway... Next, I needed to add my additional 3 fans to the setup. I plugged their fan speed control wires into motherboard fan headers. I daisy chained their 3 ARGB wires together and plugged the end into the case fan control hub, also not clearly labeled and unexplained in the case documentation. Miracle of miracles, the motherboard now sees all 6 fans and can fully control and coordinate their RGB properties via the MSI software.\n\nI hope this experience helps someone. The final result of putting some time into this case was really rewarding for me."

        "review": "This unit is great, it looks fabulous, it has excellent airflow it also has lots of lighted fans, however. If you have a regular ATX motherboard and you have or want to use a 280mm double or triple liquid cooler radiator you will not be able to fit them in the case together. after I installed my full ATX motherboard into this unit I then found that I could not fit my 280mm double3 fan radiator in the top of the case, the Ram dimms on the motherboard get in the way of the fan, and before you ask, the 280mm radiator does not fit in the forward position only on the top of the case, so I was forced to take my dremmel to cut slots in one of my Fan shrouds to allow room for the Dimms to fit when I installed the fans. This would definitely be a deal breaker for many out there, but I wasn't going to return the 280MM fans and radiator and pay more for the 240mm version, so I modified the fans to allow everything to fit. Other than this \"little\" problem the case is excellent and the design of the case is overall excellent. The wire routing can give you an extremely clean install with only a tiny bit of wires visible and the sculpted glass door on the left side is seriously cool and yes, it is Glass, not polycarbonate. the overall construction quality is excellent and is perfect for someone who is looking for a good quality case I have zero complaints about this case, with the exception of it saying it will fit a 280mm dual fan radiator as this is only technically true, but don't expect to fit your full size Motherboard afterwards. So my advice is that if you like this case and also want to use a dual fan radiator do not buy a 280mm unit, but buy the 240mm triple, double or single radiator. If you intend to install a single 280mm fan radiator I think that there should be enough room for it and the motherboard, but no double and a triple will not fit this case at all."

However, the front panel / fans hub is.. subpar. It's screwed into the inner wall of the case in a manner that it blocks one of the cable management aperture - meh. And the 'Reset' button.. does not seem to be connected anywhere from that hub. Probably it could be figured out, but I left it not working. Not that I care for a reset button, it's just that the whole item gives.. 'made in a garage' vibes :D\nOverall happy with the outcome, probably not much more to expect in its price range."

Il prodotto trasmette subito sensazioni di ottima qualità dovuta alla qualità costruttiva e materiali (ottimi) utilizzati. E' ben fatto, solido, robusto anche abbastanza pesante (secondo me una nota positiva quando si tratta di case per pc). Il case è spaziosissimo, entrano schede madri di ogni tipologia. Riesce ad ospitare sistemi di raffreddamento a liquido fino a 360 mm (ovvero il massimo che esiste al giorno d'oggi). Inoltre, è predisposto per ammettere sistemi di raffreddamento a liquido customizzati! Anche una 4090 è la benvenuta se avete in mente di farvi il pc fisso della vita. Il sistema di circolo dell'aria è ottimo, le ventole davanti preinstallate ARGB sono veloci, silenziose e colorate, fa più fresco nel mio pc che nel mio freezer. E' possibile installare ovviamente altre ventole. I pulsanti sono ben fatti, robusti, le porte usb sono molto \"strette\" (vi prego di lasciare stare doppi sensi ambigui). E' presente un comodo pulsante per cambiare gioco di luci delle ventole sul davanti poco fa menzionate. Il case offre in dotazione una centralina che permette alla vostra bellissima scheda madre di regolare velocità e luci di tutte le ventole che avete nel vostro pc (ne potete attaccare un casino). Ahimè, raccoglie un sacco di polvere, ma vabbè, cosa da tutti. A me faceva paura la lastra di vetro davanti, bella spessa, temperata, forte. E che dire più, per il mio utilizzo da gaming saltuario va più che bene, anzi è sprecato, ma anche se siete dei gamer incalliti, secondo me può fare al caso vostro, a meno che non siate dei modder estremi, forse dovete puntare più in alto. Ad ogni modo, per 100 euro, vale assolutamente la pena acquistarlo. Consigliatissimo!"

        "review": "Finally these cases seem to available in North America from time to time. I had a NZXT H1 and it never really satisfied. The AIO Pump makes a whiny buzzing noise, and I hit throttling doing my Handbrake encodings with stock settings on my 10700K. Maybe a defective cooler but I also really disliked how hot the GPU got, makes a racket with the fans spooling up. So when Coolermaster announced this Max edition of their NR200P, I had to have it as a replacement for the NZXT H1. But there was no availability all of last year. But finally these are available on Amazon and for a decent price too..$500 CAD...slightly cheaper than the $450USD seen on other US sites.\n\nThis is a great case for the builder who demands the best, but wants a simple straightforward build with the least amount of guesswork. Two of the biggest pains of building in a small form factor case is the cooling and cable management, and with this case, it's done for you. The included 280mm water cooler which is cable of handling a high performance CPU (my i7 is no problem) and a large enough case and power supply to handle very large GPUs, even a RTX 3090. The included 850W power supply means you won't run out of headroom even when the RTX4xxx series comes out.\n\nSo the process of building the PC with this case is:\n\n1) you need to supply the motherboard (mini-ITX), CPU, RAM and storage. I didn't install the RAM until later the very last step for more finger room. ITX motherboards are a bit more expensive.\n\n2) With this case, every panel comes off so remove the side, bottom panels. You can even undo the top but that's not necessary. Screw down the motherboard into the case, attach the two power cables to motherboard, and 3 cables for the headers (front panel, audio, USB). The CPU power cable is already neatly pre-routed into the top corner.\n\n3) attach the right pump bracket to the back of the motherboard for your CPU (Intel or AM4). 12th gen LGA1700 Intel is supported with an included bracket. Attach the brackets and screws for the pump unit. Use the included thermal paste and screw the pump onto the CPU.\n\n4) attach pump's power cable to the motherboard fan/pump header. Attach the dual fan cable from the water cooler to motherboard. You want to run the pump at 100% and pick a fan curve for the AIO fan. I have mine starting at 40% and ramping up to 100% at 75C.\n\n5) for the GPU, you have to remove the bracket from the case, attach the GPU to the bracket, plug the power cable(s) to the GPU, mount the bracket back into the case and then snap in the riser to the motherboard and GPU\n\nThe case can take one or two 3.5 drives and multiple 2.5 drives. I have a 2.5 storage drive and attached that to the front area with the very simple peg screws they included. After you attach the pegs to the drive, the drive just snaps into the front panel without a tool.\n\nAll in all you can do this in a couple of hours tops. On youtube, Christopher Flannigan has a step by step NR200P MAX video which is very detailed and complete. I watched that and everything was crystal clear. Highly recommended....you almost don't need the written instructions except to identify the parts.\n\nSo far so good, system is super quiet and honestly I didn't bother with the extra bottom fans like most of the youtubers did. Supposedly it helps only a little bit to improve temperatures with the vented panel but is recommended if you use the glass panel. Coolermaster's User Guide didn't mention that they are needed. Most people say adding the two bottom fans adds a lot more noise without a huge drop in temperatures. I checked my temps while gaming and everything is under 70C.\n\nI was worried that I might receive a dead AIO like some others reported, but mine is fine. I don't hear the pump unless I put my ear close to the case, and the fans are pretty quiet at 800rpm at idling temperatures. Power supply is also quiet and not really noticeable. This is definitely one of the quietest computers I've built.\n\nMy rating subtracts one star for the generally high price....you are paying for the convenience mainly as you don't save at all with this bundle. Since I bought it, I've seen the price drop below $500 a few times but mostly it hovers above $500. It's a fairly big price to pay for the convenience, you have to figure out for yourself whether you are happy with the premium.\n\nHowever, note that this case is **not** the same as the regular NR200P case, which means you cannot replicate the MAX by buying the parts separately (and Cooler Master does not sell this MAX case separately). There are differences in the back panel, the motherboard positioning compared to the regular NR200P\n\nBut in terms of value, buying the parts separately adds up to about the same as this bundle. If you get those things all on sale, it will be even cheaper. I think Coolermaster originally said this case would be $350USD, and then it would have a good value.\n\nBut if you want a high performance small-ish computer without a lot of work, this is the way to go.\n\nAlso, I'm still a bit disappointed there is no USB-C on front panel in a 2021 designed case.\nThe case looks professional and understated. There's no RGB at all, but this is a case that gets it done with no frills."

I have verified it is not a motherboard issue. Sucks, cause I am currently waiting months between orders due to the supply chain issues. I hope CoolerMaster can sort out their quality issues.\n\nUpdate: Third times a charm. After three attempts I finally have a case that is working flawlessly and looks great. 3 stars for all the quality issues."

        "review": "The NR200P Max is an outstanding design and a great successor to the NR200P. The back panel of the chassis has been completely redesigned and the case is entirely intended to be used with the included 280mm AIO Liquid Cooler and a vertically mounted GPU.\n\nLet me start by saying that it is nice to have an all inclusive purchase option from a reputable company like Cooler Master. They include a solid 280mm AIO (with fan grilles) and an 850W SFX power supply with custom length cabling. They also included a short PCIe 4.0 riser cable. Skipping the parts research step for an ITX build and some of the assembly is really nice for a lot of buyers. All you have to do is pick your CPU, board, RAM, storage, and GPU.\n\nHere's where it goes wrong. The current price is a full $130 higher than MSRP at launch. $459 seems to be the going rate right now on almost every store that sells this build kit. Even at retail prices for each item included, this is a poor value.\n\nTo make matters worse, the case currently only comes in gray, and my example came straight out of the box with the paint worn off along the top front edge of the plastic top panel. The side panels are all metal and seem to be durably painted or powdercoated. I have no doubt Cooler Master will eventually sell this setup in other colors, and hopefully back the price down, as PC components are steadily decreasing in cost at the time of this review.\n\nThe measurements of the side and front panels are the same as the NR200/NR200P, which gave me an idea. I bought a black base model NR200 and swapped out all of the black exterior parts onto my gray NR200P MAX. I reassembled the gray parts onto the base model NR200 chassis and threw that case up for sale, second hand. With the $459 price tag, I couldn't stick with the gray and be satisfied.\n\nThe case itself is excellent. The near tool-less design is outstanding, and this case is easy to work inside compared to many other small form factor designs from their competitors. Cooler Master has a solid win here, QC and pricing notwithstanding.\n\nHaving dabbled a little in SFF builds in the past several years, I want to express the lack of real benefit to most buyers for this style case, beyond operating temperatures. Most people would still be better off with a compact ATX or MATX case, either of which can certainly be built for less money. Tower style SFF cases, such as the NZXT H1 make a lot more sense for small form factor, if desk space savings is your aim. The footprint of the CM NR200 series still takes up a fair amount of room comparitively. Still, as mentioned, the thermals will be noticeably better here than with other designs. The NR200 would also make a great HTPC if you can manage its size, namely the height.\n\nLet's also talk about what this case is not. It is not an ultra-portable gaming machine. The included AIO and rock-solid chassis construction make this a little on the heavy side. This case is just too big to be ultra-portable. It probably isn't going in a backpack. Still, if moving a PC around is something you have to do, it's still a much better option than any mATX or ATX case, especially if you ditch the included glass side panel. You can save some weight by shopping smart on your GPU (plastic shrouds win here), as well as going M.2 NVMe for storage. If you want a lighter build, you might also opt for the original NR200 paired with an air cooler.\n\nIf you're looking for a portable gamer, look at the KXRORS S300 case, or anything from Velkase, if you don't mind paying a little more money.\n\nThis system supposedly only supports 2.5\" drives. At least that's what the listing led me to believe. However, upon unpacking my NR200 cases, I noticed some holes in the bottom panel that seemed very familiar. It turns out you can install a 3.5\" hard drive on the bottom panel using the included grommets and studs. You'll lose a fan space by doing this, but it should be fine if youre not using the tempered glass side panel.\n\nAs for M.2 vs SATA, I don't even see a reason to buy 2.5\" drives because M.2 NVMe SSDs are currently so close in price. You will greatly eliminate unnecessary wiring by going with M.2 NVMe for storage.\n\nThe included glass panel is worthless for a lot of builds, outside of low to mid-power setups where the CPU/GPU combo aren't making a lot of heat anyway. Higher-end setups are going to turn the glass panel case setup into a toaster. Most folks opt to stay with the mesh side panel. If you're using RGB, take your time with the wiring, so you can avoid obstructing your fans.\n\nRemember that the vertically-mounted GPU obscures most of the fans and AIO pump from view. I considered using an LED strip to provide some RGB, beyond just the RAM and GPU accents, but the case interior leaves no real room for a strip, especially since all of the panels are snapped together to the chassis. In short, you might decide to save the coin and buy non-RGB components. Additionally you'll need to use some thinner case fans on the bottom. If you don't already have fans to use, you might go to something low profile to avoid contact between the GPU riser cable and the fan housing.\n\nIf vertical GPU orientation and liquid cooling aren't important, or if you want a lightweight ITX build, stick with the base model NR200 and provide your own 850W SFX PSU. You'll certainly come out cheaper. If you want the NR200 with a relatively easy build experience and an AIO, this might be good option for you. In conclusion, Cooler Master has an outstanding formula here. They just need to come back down to Earth and give their customers what they want, at a more reasonable price, while making sure it goes out the door in \"new\" condition. This case has all of the other ingredients to be a 5-star Hall of Fame ITX case."

        "review": "I really like the way this case looks and how modular it is. You can fit a lot of stuff in there, which is great, but cable managing all of it is definitely a with how small of a space you have to work with. I am not a beginner in the pc building department, but not an expert by any means, and it was a long and difficult process for me to get everything sorted in this.\n\nWith that said, this thing is great. I fit a full length Asrock Phantom Gaming RX6950 XT with no problem. This card is huge and the case handled it perfectly, with the included PCIE riser. While the case definitely gets hot with the included AIO cooler, I have never experienced any sort of thermal throttling. The AIO tube length is perfect for the size case and relatively easy to install on the AM5 platform. Cooler Master definitely did a solid with the included SFX 80 plus gold power supply. All in for this package is a very reasonable price considering the custom AIO and pre ran cables.\n\nVery satisfied with my purchase."

        "review": "The CM NR200p max is a good system. I’ve been looking to build a SFF system for over a year now. I finally decided to build one since I’ve been using the MSI TridentX2 (beast of a gaming PC). For anyone thinking twice about this PC, you should get it. I will say that if you never built a PC or don’t like tweaking things multipolar times, you may find building a PC like this stressful. But I can say it really isn’t stressful at all. The AIO in this system is top notch, the PSU is good even enough for the 40 series and we’ll constructed SFF.\n\nMy specs I have a MSI Z790i edge Wi-Fi motherboard\n6000 TridentZ ram 32gb\nTwo CoolerMaster Halo2 gen 2 140mm fans( replaced radiator 140mm)\nIntel i7-13700k\nTwo Noctua 120mm 15s for bottom intake fans\n\nWhen I first built the PC the temps were my biggest concerns especially for a SFF like this. However after tweaking and watching a few YouTube videos, I was able to get the i7-13700k under good temps. When I first stated I was getting 70-80c when gaming but nothing over 80c. You definitely need to undervolt the i7 it runs hot. To do this, you can simply go into your bios and if your motherboard supports it, use CPU lite load. It’s one of the easiest ways to undervolt. I think everyone starts at default(mode 9). The pc will most likely throttle when running stress test.\n\nI switched mine to mode 2(CPU lite load) and one other thing, you must use an aggressive fan tuning. If you have good fans, you won’t hear much when the fans are ramped up a bit.I have attached a photo of my fan curves. Also I can use the mesh or tempered glass with this unit. TG gives me 1-2c temps more but due to my bottom 2 noctua fans and my fan curves I get great temps while gaming. Also when doing regular computer task.\n\nKeep in mind, it all depends on what you’re trying to accomplish with your PC build. But if you plan on gaming, web browsing, school work, YouTube or nothing like streaming or 4k editing you should be just find. I did not test the system for 4k editing or streaming but I’m sure the PC would run hotter as those events add more stress to the PC.\n\nJust YouTube and you will find how to fine tune your build based on your needs and you should be just fine. For me, this is a great little PC with good cooking exactly what I needed for my needs."

        "review": "The TLDR is that this case is great. I bought another to build a new work computer, and both cases are keeping cool. I did replace the fans with Scythe 140mm fans on the radiator and 120mm slim fans for the bottom on both my home and work builds since both are similar enough.\n\nIt's been a while since I built a computer and kind of set it and forgot about it. I've dusted out the home machine once since I got that one. Otherwise my only gripe was the paint on the original case but again, that literally buffed out. The second case didn't even have much in the way of spots on the paint or anything.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review below:\n\nI had an original nr200 that I moved an old itx build into about a year ago and loved it. I honestly wish I had kept it instead of selling and keeping my atx build. But I probably wouldn't have gone with this then. So, it's a win. After waiting 7+ months for this case, between seeing it in reviews and not knowing where to get it until it hit Amazon/Newegg, I'd say it was worth the wait.\n\nThis comes with two minor caveats, for me at least, that I can't imagine many people have run into.\n\nI got my *first* delivery and was missing the riser cable and one of the pcie power cables. The box looked unopened so I'll say it was a packing issue from the factory. I did try to just go through the order page to exchange it but was only given the option to return. I'd imagine this is due to the cost of the item as a whole. A call with an Amazon rep got this turned into an exchange.\n\nThe second little gripe I have is with the paint. On the first and second item, the paint looked a little weird. Not really scuffs but I had to take a little polish to the panels to clean them up. Not a big deal, but if someone is paying close to or over 450 for this great package, and technically for a specific color, I would think the qc on the paint would be a better.\n\nI popped an x570i Strix board with my 5900x and Strix 3080. Everything fit like a glove. The cooler does have a little whine in the pump but I keep the machine of to the side and have a fan on most of the time so it's not audible. I did change the top fans out though for the Silverstone Penatrator ARGB fans to get a little more flair but the stock fans were more than capable of get the hot air through the radiator. I matched these up with their 120mm Slimmer fans.\n\nIf you don't already have a computer built or want to downsize from an ATX build like my situation, this is the way to go. Be weary that the psu comes with 2x PCIE power cables that have 2 plugs daisy chained each. I don't really see this as a problem but I know there are disadvantages to this according to the internet pc building gods. I had a custom cable made anyway to add a third and there are plenty of people on etsy that can provide such a product or a full set of cables if needed. I paired this with a set of those 90 degree adapters too so it looks extra clean.\n\nI think if Coolermaster sold this version of the case, without the psu, cooler, riser, etc, for the same price as the normal nr200, I think they'd still sell a ton. Great case overall, probably never going mid/full size build again because of it."

It's much more spacious and works really well if you have a monster card like the 4090.\n\nThere are so many configuration options with this case. Want your bottom fans to lay flat instead of an angle? You can change that.\n\nWant your PSU to be lower for cable management? You can do that.\n\nWant to remove the front IO ports entirely or move them to the rear of the case? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nThe back of the case has all these slots making cable management EASY! You can hide every cable with the back door panel.\n\nThe button up top makes it super easy to control the lights.\n\nThe case comes with zip ties, extra screws, A GPU BRACKET HOLDER (shown in pic) AND they even include a plastic screw box kit for you to hold all extra screws.... CRAZY.\n\nThe case also has tons of options for cable management on the back panel.\n\nAIRFLOW IS OUTSTANDING...\n\nNow for the few negatives. Trust me these are really just nitpicks...\n\n- Too complicated to take panels off. You need to remove the top one first, the side glass panel, THEN the front panel... They're connected with screws and you'll need to whip out the good ol screwdriver every time you need to go in to adjust anything.. (coming from an old o11 case this isn't ideal)\n\n- HEAVY. But tbh this shouldnt be a bother.. it's kind of expected with this beast of a case.\n\n- No way to control the onboard RGB lights via software.. limited to what onboard options there are. (Doesn't personally bother me but I did want to point that out)\n\n- Good luck getting this delivered with no damage. Mine arrived about a month after I ordered it and it was supposed to arrive within 2 days, then 1 week, then 2 weeks. Got lucky and it eventually arrived after cancelling, however, it came damaged with a big ol' dent in the back of the case. You cant see it when on the desk so it's not a huge deal I suppose. But for the price, I definitely expect it to come in perfect condition.\n\nSummary:\n\nI love this case. It's filled with lots of thoughtful options to configure your build YOUR way. All while retaining an eye candy look. It's pricey but worth it for the aesthetics and airflow. I would only recommend this case if you are wanting a bigger case than a Mid Tower case and you plan on adding 9-12 fans. Really, I recommend 12 fans for the best look. If you do any less, it will look weird and you're better off getting something smaller like the NZXT flow or o11 dynamic etc. Overall, pleased with the case. Just wish it didn't come damaged for me! Oh well!"

        "review": "TL;DR - This case has absolutely everything needed for a home builder to make a rig as big and beautiful as you see online with relative ease. Things can always improve and I look forward to seeing if Phanteks can improve on this, but as for current cases, you won't find better.\n\nLong Story:\nI very rarely write reviews. Maybe I should, maybe not. But I HAD to write a review for this product. I've worked with many cases in my life, I've built many custom rigs. This case is far and away the best. I'm sure from a construction and utility point of view there are MANY that can easily compare, and perhaps there are many that are cheaper than this case. This case, however, was designed perfectly with the home builder in mind. Every compartment is easy to access, cable routing is beyond easy and beautiful once completed (pics will come in once my video card arrives and I complete the build). It's also the most forgiving case I've ever worked with. Forgot to tie a cable down before connecting? No worries, the built in straps are easy to take off without having to fully re-route that cable or any others. Accidentally put the wrong AIO cooling mount on the back of the motherboard? Don't fret, there's a compartment in the back that opens with full access to the cpu cooler mounting bracket. There was only ONE screw that I had to use a screwdriver on to get to what I needed which is unheard of in my experience. But the best part for me, the cherry on top if you will, the case comes with a compartment box, filled with additional screws and parts needed for the build. I was able to put in additional screws from other components and now I have a full compartment case of extra bits to use for any future replacements or updates. I know it doesn't sound like much and it may be ignored upon unpacking, but as you're building and you drop a screw you'll think \"whatever, I'll pick it up off the ground later, I have MORE RIGHT HERE!!!\" And you'll realize how awesome this is (yes I did go back and pick up the two screws I dropped...)."

A little bit smaller profile, so that might work.\nIf you don't want to spend the money, but want a good case, check out the Phanteks G360A.\nI have that one, and it is AMAZING."

        "review": "I followed the directions disassembling this case and it took a few minutes and was simple. Plenty of room to install all the components and route the cables so they are all hidden. The RGB looks nice and isn't overwhelming. If you want to be blasted with RGB I would use something different. If you use fans with lights those can be seen from 5 sides.\n\nCase is real sturdy and takes a full-grown person or two to safely move. I set mine on a stand that gave me access to all sides and I didn't move it after that. Most removeable parts are thumbscrews or single cross-tip screws that are easy to access."

        "review": "Case is durable, though that means it will also be a bit heavier than cheap knockoff lookalikes.\n\nA 240 GPU radiator can fit for exhaust on rear, along with 360 radiator on top exhaust. Ensures almost NO hot air from both high power components dump hot air inside the case. Can run 4 side 120 fans and 3 bottom 120 or 140 fans for intake.\n\nIf using new released gpu bracket, you *might* be able to keep 3 bottom fans if they are not put on the incline mount position, but the pci riser cable from bracket will put alot of pressure on mobo pci slot, so I just did a single bottom fan and tilted bracket back to relieve strain on pci slot.\n\nRgb is pretty good. All devices in picture are connected to the case hub, half on channel 1, half on channel 2. Only thing is, there isn't many effects to choose from, and no brightness setting either. Also, connecting to motherboard header for control from case hub, about 2-3 fans wouldn't get rgb. Likely the NZXT N7 board I'm using, just something to keep in mind."

If you have a liquid cooled GPU, you're going to have to bend the hell out of the hoses to close the case. You need to take apart half the case just to put a fan in. You have to turn the PC on it's side to remove the bottom filter. Only case I've seen in the past decade that needs to be disassembled just to open the side panel. I could go on.

        "review": " This is a great case for a show build, and flexible if you have specific needs like I do. I wanted a display case for my custom-built ATX 4090 / 5800X3D, but I don't have room on my desk for a typical right-side case. I needed a left build or something similar. I also needed something that would fit on the desk in a reasonable way and that wasn't too big. I looked at the Thermaltake 500. Looked cool, but the dimensions were a little off for my space, interior design seemed questionable in some ways, was a bit worried about the thermals, and read some negative reviews. Also looked at the Segotep T1. Again, not fully confident in the case and the size was a little too big. Lian Li has a great reputation, the size of the 011 Dynamic EVO was right (the XL looks amazing but BIG), and the needed accessories were reeadily available. I decided to go for it.\n\nI'm quite pleased with the end result, the case has incredible build quality, and looks awesome, BUT it was not an easy build for what I did (reverse build with upright GPU). That said, it did come out essentially perfect.\n\nI used the black 011 Dynamic EVO in reverse. Case set up was not too bad. Everything went in fine, but getting the GPU positioned and attached properly was a challenge. If you're looking to do the upright GPU, be sure you get the updated bracket (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1Z2WVYM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and 600mm extension (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XJRHYCT?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). I also used a 16Pin Right Angle Adapter for the GPU (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWDVC44J?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). Made the job easier and looks better. For fans I went with the AsiaHorse Matrix (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LQ9FKKJ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to add some side RGB and cut down on fan cables.\n\nTemps have been pretty good and equivalent to (if not below) the temps I was getting in the Corsair 4000D. Around 35c at idle and up to the 70s under load. Have the 3 bottom fans and rear fan on intake and the two AIO fans, plus 3 fans mounted behind the GPU set for exhaust. Cable mangement is good, everything fits including the hard drive cage. I did set the PSU on the bottom. Fixing the bottom bracket for that orientation in reverse was tough becuase the bracket doesnt have cut-outs for the screwdriver in that orientation. My GPU is an MSI Gaming X Trio and it fits fine, if snug. I did go with a 240 AIO because the 5800X3D runs cool and a longer AIO would be a tight fit with the GPU, but probably possible.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this case but caution that it's not an easy build. If you want a really well-made case that's not enormous (like the 011 XL), especially one that can do a left-side build with an upright GPU, this is a great case. Go for it."

I suggest doing it before everything else, including installing the PSU afterwards. Cable management is all confined to the read center piece allowing you to conceal a web of messes. The only real co plaint with installing the upright GPU is this simply. The entire hole for the top cable management to hide others becomes fully occupied by a PCI-E Riser cable. Expect outstanding ambient air drops on your gpus backplate, don't install the panel that is used to mount addition ssds and the GPU upright, use that space for fans! I'm using the Artic P12 aRGBs mostly in this case. Besides for the radiator for my EVGA RTX 3080 XC3 Hybrid Water Cooler as seen hiding the tubing the front. I also installed mostly pressure dynamic fans because their cfm is rated above 40 and they're pushing air harder through all components and radiators throughout the case. I did notice a negative 10 degree celiua drop on my CPU loads! It's throttling between 35-40 standard, 50 C gaming on ultra with and performance boosts no oc. 70 c under stress testing. Great thermal dynamics with Artic products throughout the case. As for the GPU. Wow!!! 28 under no Boost locking, 30-40 gaming water cooled. Amazing case."

The box was not fastened to anything, so it bounced around while in transit and got a little damaged, but the mount itself was fine.\n\nI like how the top of the case has separate audio ports for mic and audio. The power and reset buttons click when you press them, they're not on springs, so any animal that jumps on top may end up pressing them.\n\nThe hinged door is easy to open, close and remove. It seems nice to have, but realistically you'll rarely make use of it since any time you need to open the case, you're going to take the door off the hinges or it will be getting in the way.\n\nAll of the preinstalled fans squeak when they spin. I bought the MSI MAG Core Liquid 360R V2 AIO for this case which uses the same type of fans and they squeak too. Also, the front fans are too far forward which reduces air intake effectiveness.\n\nThe holes under the magnetic filter on the top of the case made screwing in my AIO a little difficult. After screwing it in, I noticed the screw heads aren't completely level with the case so they leave tiny bumps in the filter when it's on.\n\nThe side panel has screw catches so when you unscrew them they don't fall out. It's easy to remove and put back on. The side panel bulges about 2mm from the 24 pin power cable, even though I've tied it tight to the case with zip ties.\n\nThere are plenty of places to tie things down inside the case, but some of the hole positions make routing certain cables a pain. The USB cable was especially annoying to plug into my ATX motherboard. I had to run it up through the bottom middle hole then curve it around in a big circle to reach the USB connector pins.\n\nThe case has\n\nThe ARGB fan hub only has 6 ARGB connectors, so if you plan on installing more ARGB fans or an AIO you'll need to daisy chain some of the ARGB cables together or buy a bigger hub. Not that big a deal really, but it does make cable management messy.\n\nI bought this case for $173, but it seems more like an $80-120 case with all the problems I've experienced with it. Reviewers on YouTube picked up on these things, and I regret not watching those reviews before buying it."

Wish there was more airflow from the bottom of case (nobody is installing HDD anymore with ssd so cheap) when purchased i pictured putting fans on the bottom to increase airflow but the vent on the bottom of the case is only PSU where they could have extended the vent all the way to the front they didnt its just unused space to stuff your cables. 2nd the Front USB cable and connector is very stiff and i couldnt bend the cable enough to fit into the mobo with the GPU rad installed where it is. Other than that its a great budget case for the average user if your gonna spend over 2k tho on your other components, you want better airflow or you prefer a clear look. id recomend the hyte Y60 which is what i should have went with. But this case has great cable management looks good and comes with 4 rgb fans and magnetic dust covers."

First, be careful about buying any third-party cable of low quality which can result in strange issues when you operate your system. Plus, note the portion of the cable that mounts to the bracket. The holes may not be a good match to mount securely. Also, be careful to purchase the proper Riser Cable that is compatible with the PCIe version of the motherboard and video card used. For example, you don’t want to use a PCIe 3.0 Riser Cable with a PCIe 5.0 motherboard and a PCIe 4.0 video card. It will work, it is backward compatible BUT this will inhibit the PCIe 4.0 video card from reaching full performance by half and wasting a lot of bucks spent on expected video card performance. The same advice applies if the video card is mounted directly to the motherboard. More or less, the motherboard PCIe version must be higher than any PCIe version device plugged into it to get full performance, including connecting cables in between. This brings me to the point. There is a high quality PCIe 4.0 Riser Cable preferred for the Velox 100R available from MSI that can be properly mounted to the bracket (it matches the bracket mount) which will be fully compatible with a PCIe 4.0 video card on a PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 motherboard (my situation) but there was an issue discovered while trying to purchase the cable. MSI, at the time this post was made, only used Paypal as their means for online payment. Typically, a one-time payment can be made through Paypal WITHOUT having to open an account with Paypal and this is echoed during the MSI purchase process as “Don’t have a Paypal Account? No worries, PayPal would also let you pay with Debit or Credit Card. And here is HOW.” Clicking on HOW (it was a link) displays a pop-up showing the one-time purchase button labeled “Pay with Debit or Credit Card” and the remarks “Once you have selected this option, you will be moved to the following screen where you will be able to enter your credit card information WITHOUT needing a PayPal account.” But this wasn’t the case, after clicking the “PayPal” button the next pop-up labeled “Check out as a guest” requested my email address. After entering the email address and clicking “Continue to Payment” the next pop-up display wanted the credit card information to complete the purchase BUT the only button available to click at this point was labeled “Create Account & Continue” or a link to log into a PayPal account. There was no option to just continue with the purchase without opening an account (this process began to smell a bit). I tried the available button which did create an account with PayPal (and was later deleted). I even tried different browsers to confirm it wasn’t a browser issue. I have made many one-time purchases from other web sites using the one-time option during the Paypal purchase process but strangely this was not available during the MSI purchase process even though it is offered. When MSI was contacted about this they mentioned “PayPal is currently our exclusive method of payment until further notice.” In their response MSI did not discuss the faulty one-time purchase option explained to them. It’s a shame you’re FORCED to open a PayPal account to do business with MSI. My advice is you had better read closely the user agreement for Paypal and be sure it is acceptable if you choose to keep an account (the Devil is in the details). I’ll probably go third party to obtain the Riser Cable at this point. After decades of building PC’s my first experience with an all MSI build may very well be my last. Now you know!"

The only reason this case is getting 4 stars and not 5 is the MSI fans that came with at are not very good. I switched all the fans to Phantecks with 3 140mm fans in the front and a T30 in the back, the new fans made a big difference with cooling. Over all I am very satisfied with the quality of this case, another win for MSI."

J'aime que le support pour carte graphique vertical soit inclus bien qu'il aurait pu y avoir l'extension comprise.\n\nLes matériaux sont bon. Par contre, devoir démonter la partie du haut et l'avant pour nettoyer les filtres est un gros moin. Aussi, plutôt que d'avoir coller certain autocollants sur les plastiques protecteur, ils ont été collé directement sur le verre. Ca complique trop les choses et difficile d'enlever sans égratigner le verre.\n\n41cm d'espace pour installer la carte graphic est un gros plus car plusieurs tours de cette dimension sont limitée de ce côté là. Pas de port USB 3.1 type C :-( Aussi, inutile de payer l'extra pour le model rgb. Juste acheter la moin chère et ensuite ajouter les fans voulu, c'est meilleur marché.\n\nLa nouvelle version a le PSU shroud que le vieu model n'a pas. Tres bien, mais Thermaltake aurait pu en mettre un en vente à bon prix pour ceux qui ont le vieu model car il est dans la nouvelle version, gratuitement. On peut acheter le PSU shroud sur certains site mais à 80$ c'est ridicule. Je vais en faire un moi même.\n\nLe verre trempé sur 4 surfaces, wow! Très jolie! Un peut trop sombre mais avec un bon éclairage c'est pas très grave. Tres épais, très résistant! Mais aussi, plutôt pesant. Ma tour est d'un poid similair à mon full tower Corsair Obsidian 900D, qui est beaucoup plus grosse que celle si.\n\nIl pourrait aussi y avoir quelques panneaux pour cacher les câbles, d'un côté et de l'autre.

I knew this thing was going to be big but I gotta say it is a VERY BIG CASE. It offers a lot of options in terms of fan radiator mounts and GPU mounting compared with other cases in the same price range. Very good value for the money if you have the space for this thing. My only dislikes with this product is the placement of the Power Button is easy to accidently hit if the case is placed below the desk which hers is, and the fact I had to purchase the GPU riser cable separately - they should include this.

It certainly has a wow factor. The bad news is that these fans are using a proprietary connector/fan controller, which, while that does have the ability to extend to another controller board, no cable is included to do so. Also, the fans that are included are at a fixed speed; which I'm not in favor of. When my system is not in use; the beast that it is, I like to either shut off or minimize what I can (though keep it running as I do access it remotely); both as a power bill reducer and as a thermal load reducer. Costs money to run it, costs money to cool the room it's in too! Plus maybe that environmental aspect, but not a priority, TBH. So, in order to bling this out as much as possible, those awesome looking fans have to go along with the controller they run off of =/\n\nIt's worth noting that one can fit, barely, 3x140mm fans inside between the left and right chamber, and there's a vent with a magnetic mesh on the right side of the case, lined up for it. With my spare non-LED fans there, I can feel it pulling in air through that. Nice! I also put a 140mm temporarily on the bottom, though it's meant for 120mm; so there's only 2 screws holding it and it is wider than the bottom vent. Accomplishes the goal of putting cooler air directly on my video card; rather than before where it was sitting above the power supply getting air off the backside of the 360 radiator pulling air from the front.\n\nTo that note, I have the 360 radiator mounted on the inside top of the case. Slick mounting system allows one to bump the bracket for the radiator over if one uses a 280mm radiator or need to for a 360 if you have a hose clearance issue. I mounted it with the hoses towards the back, there's a gap between the IO area and the VRM area, where the radiator hoses clear through no issue. Related to the slick mounting system; if one does use a 280 up there, you won't be able to put 200mm fans on top. I plan to in addition as there is a bit of a stagnant area surrounding the radiator.\n\nHDD mounting is rear, or optionally from the top; behind the top panel; not really sure why either would be preferred over the other. Not that keen on position, as it puts the HDDs right behind the CPU; both I am certain contribute to heating the other and likely makes for a hot spot inside teh case; as there are no fans to move air in that area; path of least resistance says all the air would flow from the vents near the front half of the case. Perhaps there's room for a 40-60mm fan nearby; will explore that. There's an option for a pair of 2.5\" drives to be mounted on the bottom, but then no fans in that area. Also comes with a water pump/reservoir mounting bracket; normally they don't so if I opt to do a custom loop later, I can; but will lose a 120mm fan mounting area on the bottom.\n\nI marked the case down a few notches on noise level; mainly, you'll hear everything inside it because the top and front have nothing to filter/diffuse it. The included fans are quiet though, just mine for the radiator are noisy, and I have aggressive fan curves to get ahead of the fireball that the 2990wx can be when a load is put on it. Of note, the only dust filtration are on the right side panel (magnetic) as well as on the bottom. Those front fans are going to pull in a decent amount of dust (and in my case, cat hair) but not that big of a deal; to that, I've found that the mesh filters that most systems are using don't filter THAT well anyway; still end up having to blow out dust every so often.\n\nAs for ventilation, it does really well, actually; better than I thought it would considering the open-top I was using before with my previous case, but the fan positioning on the bottom is so much better, and I'm not drawing in air to heat it up with the radiator and then have everything else just kind of deal with it; instead I'm drawing in a lot of cool air from the front, side chamber, and bottom, and then blowing it out the back and through the radiator. I thought my CPU temps would suffer a bit, but nope! I sit between 36-40c idle in a room that's around 75F ambient (vs previous it'd be about 38-42c) and when throwing something at it using all cores 100% using some testing software, it stabilizes at 60C (previously it'd hit max @ 65c and start dropping cores to 2GHz round-robin style to keep it from going over that), and I might be able to bring that down a bit with a bit of adjusting of the curves; especially once I get the replacement fans involved; as the fans I can control are topping out at 85% rate.\n\nOverall pretty happy with the case. One more thing - the ARGB LEDs are fantastic in this series of fans, my toddler surprised me, I set it to blue (cullee bwoo!!!), then red (cullee wed!!!), then green (cullee geeen!!!), then I thought I'd trick him and put it on one that mixes and shifts it...cullee wainbow!!!! What? Who taught him that? LOL"

Preinstalled fans keep the air moving through the gaps. It's tranquil in its default configuration. I used an AIO to keep fan noise down.\n\nI recently also picked up a riser cable since GPUs are now scarily large, and I hate how they sag in the PCIe sockets. Rotating the back plate around was reasonably straightforward, though the screws feel like they didn't go in the same.\n\nThe area behind the motherboard has plenty of room for extra cables and tie-downs. I had to trim down a drive. There are only two 3.5\" HDD bays, with room for 2 2.5\" drives in the front and apparently on the outside of the 3.5\" drive bay, but I didn't have any drives that size to explore with.\n\nOverall, this is a very nice case, and I'm thrilled with the purchase."

        "review": "Very large case but I knew this going in. I decided to purchase this over the Lian Li and the Corsair due to the USB type C and the USB 3.0 ports on the front and the ability to use 140mm fans on this case. (Lian Li no fans included and only supports 120mm fans). The corsair does not have the USB -C or the USB 3.0.\n\nOverall the case was fairly easy to work on. A few hiccups.\n1. The case does not come with a pci-e riser cable you need to also purchase one. The 300mm Thermaltake is plenty long enough. I would recommend staying with the Themaltake riser because there are two screws on the vertical GPU plate that need to be connected to the riser cable and I am not 100% positive that they are universal.\n2. Another vertical gpu mount note: It took me a bit to figure out but you can only mount the GPU in the vertical position when the top GPU back cover is removed. When you have the case you will know what this note means.\n3. This case is really meant for water cooling and there is ample room for this. I may want to upgrade to water cooling in the future and hence the reason to buy the case.\n4. The top and front fan mounting brackets can be repostioned which was a nice plus. I moved my top mounting bracket to a closer position to the glass panel so I was able to put my RGB and fan controllers on top of the case for easier access.\n5. As on previous reviews the included RGB controller is solely meant for the included fans and has to be reset for the MOBO to control the RGB.\n6. The rear included RGB fan did not have solid sides so I immediately replaced it with a corsair fan. It bothered the hell out of me to look at it.\n7. The side mount fans are intake fans. I was originally going to mount my radiator there but, I would be recirculating hot air into the case.\n8. I would not have this case on the floor or in any dusty environment. There is a half inch unfiltered gap around all of the glass on the case.\n9. No one make white 200mm RGB fans. So you are stuck with the 200mm fans.\n10. Very quiet for having 11 fans going. CPU runs 5 degrees cooler then my old Fractal design R4 case.\n11. Only 2 slot for SSD HD drives in rear. Came with mounting brackets for the bottom of the case to mount more....but that would look stupid. M.2 Drives are so much better and I don't know who would need more then that.\n12. Top of the case has to be jiggled a bit to go into place.\n13. Power button does illuminate if you connect it correctly. (I saw a review that complained that it does not illuminate)\n14. If you drill into the side you might be able to mount 3 140mm fans, misleading specs on website.\n15. Ample room to run RGB lights around glass door, but because case is so big you may need extension cables.\n16. This is an ATX case. DO NOT TRY TO USE FOR EATX.\n17. This case is all glass so you need to have good cable management in the viewable side but the backside can be a disaster.\n18. Make sure that you thoroughly plan out any cables for the bottom of the MOBO because you will need to unmount PSU, GPU and riser cable to make ANY adjustments to these cables.\n19. There is very little room behind the PSU to route cables and you will need to unmount PSU to make ANY adjustments.\n20.

This case runs quiet, has dust filters over every major airflow port, and keeps things cool inside. By far the best case NZXT has to offer if you don't care for a flashy looking case and care about your rig staying cool inside. I will definitely keep this case for the long haul. Another pro is how easy they make clean cable management and all the USB ports on the tower be connected via one cord. Simplifying the process."

I'd been really interested in it for awhile, as it was the cheapest non-ITX airflow case on Amazon, and honestly it met all my expectations and more. Building in it with a micro-ATX board was smooth, the airflow is solid, and while the cable management chamber wasn't on par with a $200 case, I was able to stow everything away without too much issue. Room for two SSDs and two HDDs (in addition to any M.2's your board can fit) offers more than enough expand ability for most people.\n\nObviously this case has its drawbacks. You're limited to 120mm fans and a single 240mm front radiator, building on a full ATX would probably be a bit less smooth, and if you've got a million RGB cables then you may very well run out of room to discretely stow them. But this isn't the case you get for flash - it's the case you get when you don't care about looks and just want something cheap and practical. If your overclocked I9 needs a 360 RGB AIO, then this isn't the case for you.\n\nThis thing has the room and airflow to support the latest tech running the latest games or programs at good temperatures, at a better price than anything else on the market right now. If that's what you're looking for, then this will provide."

Some design choices for cable routing options (or lack thereof) make little sense. For instance, the access for routing your atx power cable is so small, fitting an 8 pin through it is near impossible. Some thumb screws are plastic. I find that inexcusable as a cost cutting measure. The rear chassis fan provided was horrible and borderline non-functional. I replaced that with a Thermalright 120mm fan. If it's within the budget, spend the extra $25-$30 and look at something higher quality."

        "review": "This is my second Cougar case in the last 6 years. Although this MX330-G is a bit smaller than my old one, it's much easier to build in.\nPros:\n• Very spacious inside.\n• There are more than enough holes to make cable management a breeze.\n• The PSU bay is large enough to accommodate a larger than ATX standard PSU and has more than enough room to tuck away unused cables if you don't have a modular PSU .\n• There is a lot of room between the front panel and the front chassis frame. I had more than enough room for the fans. Fitting a water cooling radiator should be no problem.\n• The airflow potential is outstanding. The mesh front panel and the top exhaust, plus the included 120mm rear fan make airflow, well, a breeze. I put two 90mm fans in the front pulling air in, and one 90mm fan at the top pulling air out. My CPU and GTX GPU are not getting even close to max temp under max load. Vape testing reveals the air is being pulled directly out of the two exhaust fans. The combination of spaciousness and airflow is really the best feature of this case. I would definitely recommend going double 120mm fans in the front, and double 120mm fans at the top, but 90mm is what I had already and it seems to be working fine.\n• There are no sharp edges and everything seems to fit together as it should. The rigidity of the case is slightly better than expected for the price, but after installing the power supply, it felt even a little more rigid.\n• The clear side panel glass has rubber grommets on both sides to prevent damage from overtightening of the screws. I really like this feature.\n• The back side panel comes off and goes on easier than any other case I've ever dealt with, and the cable management concave area is bloody perfect size.\n\nCons: (it was pretty hard to find any real cons, so I'm just being nit-picky here)\n• The clear side panel screws are just barely long enough. They do the job of holding the side panel on adequately, but I would have preferred and extra millimeter or two for some extra comfort-of-mind.\n• When installing the mechanical hdd in the trays, you have to use slim topped screws. The standard hex-sided phillips screws will prevent the tray from sliding in.\n• The external PCIe slot bracket thingy is kinda wonky and I'm not even sure of the purpose it serves. It must be removed to screw/unscrew PCIe card retaining screws, but it does not appear to offer any retention properties on it's own. I don't think it's there for anything other than looks.\n• The optical drive mount should be a little longer/stronger. For any of the people still holding on to optical drives, I'd recommend using a short one in this case, rather than a standard size long drive.\n\nOverall, this case was much better than expected for the $52 price and I would not hesitate to buy it again for future builds. The aesthetics are just fine with me. Considering the airflow tests I've done, I'm not sure why I would buy a more expensive case. I'm glad I got this instead of some of the $30-$40 cases I was looking at."

        "review": "So here I am, writing this review for the case I bought using my newly built PC using the case as I write this. Honestly, for about $45, the amount in which I bought the case (not counting shipping fees and state tax), this is a pretty amazing case. Don't get me wrong, it's not the best case compared to more higher-end cases such as NZXT's H510 case, but for what its worth, if you want a PC case that looks pretty neat and has a high amount of airflow, then the Cougar MX330-G is the perfect PC case for you!\n\nPROS:\n- It has a LOT (and I mean a LOT) of airflow thanks to the mesh on the front and top panels, and it supports up to five cooling fans up to 120mm (two for the intake, one for exhaust, and two on the ceiling of the case), essentially keeping your PC nice and cool, even in the toughest workloads, meaning you won't have to worry so much about your PC overheating. It also supports water cooling radiators from 120mm up to 240mm.\n- Supports up to two 2.5\" SSDs and two 3.5\" HDDs, allowing you to store as many games and software as both your SSDs and HDDs can handle when combined.\n- Comes with a transparent tempered glass window panel, allowing you to see your parts nice and clearly. It's also perfect if you want to show off builds such as full RGB builds (like mine), or builds that utilize water cooling thanks to its minimalist style (more on that later).\n- Supports graphics cards up to 350mm in length (up to 13.8\")\n- Very minimalist style and comes with dust covers for your PSU and 3.5\" drive bay, making your PC look even better, especially when going for a theme/style for your PC.\n- I/O Panel comes with two USB 2.0 slots, two USB 3.0 slots, Audio Jack, Mic In, and a Reset Switch.\n- It also comes with a magnetic dust filter on the top of the case, essentially making sure little to no dust gets inside of your case, which also means you don't have to clean the inside of the case as often.\n- The interior of the case is nice and spacious, allowing for upgrades as well for your starting PC too.\n\nCONS:\n- Cable management isn't the best with this case, but it's fine. (If anything, would recommend a semi/full modular PSU)\n\nThe Verdict:\nWhile not the best case in the world compared to the more higher-end cases that are more costly, for what its worth (around $50 depending on where and who you're getting it from, not counting shipping fees and state tax), the Cougar MX330-G is nonetheless an amazing case, and is a great starting case for those who are getting into the world of PC building. It also makes for a good case when it comes to budget building too, the only downside being its cable management; it's not the best unlike other cases such as NZXT's H510 case, but it's fine nonetheless, as it is definitely outweighed by the many positives this case has to offer. If you're looking for a case that has a minimalist style, a tempered glass window panel, and excellent airflow but don't want to spend too much on the case, then Cougar's MX330-G just may be the case for you."

        "review": " Throughout the past few weeks I've been constantly searching for a good case for my current rig as I've had the Corsair Carbide 100R for about 4 years, and as you can see I've decided on this one: the Cougar MX330-G.\n\nPros:\nGood price\nGreat quality\nLightweight\nBetter air intake\nCable management\nStylish\nsweg\nCons:\nscrews may be too small for mounting fans/AIO in inner front panel of case (I'd invest in extra screws just in case)\n-------------------------------\n\nFirst impression:\nAesthetically pleasing and lightweight with a high quality material especially for being around $50. As I'm sure many of you fancy looking at the beautiful lighting and components of your build, this give you a tinted tempered glass with four hand screws to allow you to easily access anything within. The metal mesh front of the case allows for more air intake (especially with my Uphere RGB fans).\n-------------------------------\n\nTesting Temps:\n\nIdle temps:\nSystem Temp: 28-34c\nCPU Temp: 27-35 c\n\nGaming Temps: (MGSV PHANTOM PAIN)\nCPU Temp: 45-50c\n-------------------------------\n\nBuilding Experience:\n\nTaking off any panel of the case, whether it was cable side panel, tempered glass or front panel, everything came out with ease, that way you don't feel as if you're going to break the bloody thing. Expansion slots has a stylish screw cover that allows to access your screws without any frustration (at least in my opinion).\n\nATX Motherboard (MSI Z97A GAMING 6) went on without a hassle and there was sufficient room above to add/remove 120m fans, possibly 240mm liquid cooler. there is room for a 240mm liquid cooler at the front of the case and has a small indentation to ensure that it allows room to avoid the possibility of a difficult/tight fit. Additionally, although it comes with a Cougar 120mm rear fan, it is able to mount a 120mm liquid cooler for anyone who would want to.\nAnother point to add, as I was going over the dimensions of the case, my HYPER 212 BLACK EDITION fit perfectly.\n\nMounting the two 120mm fans at the front of the case and above was where I had a bit of an issue. I'm not entirely sure that all these case may have this issue, but I notices that the 4 long screws to mount the fans had an issue with going into the mounting holes. After some time, I had to reuse older small screws (from my Corsair Carbide 100R case) to mount the fans on both sections; I installed the bolts from the inner part of the front so the fans that sit in between the front panel and the inner front panel of the case are sturdy. For the top portion I mounted them normally with the corsair screws.\n\nAttaching all the other components was just peachy.\n-------------------------------\nPC SPECS:\nCPU: i7-4790k\nGPU: MSI GEFORCE GTX1080 TI GAMING X 11G\nSSD: Kingston SA400M8240G 240GB (SSD IN M.2 2280)\nHDD: WD Blue 1TB (2012)\nRAM: G.SKILL RipjawsX DDR3 1600 C9 2x4GB\nPSU: Corsair CX750M\nMBD: MSI Z97A GAMING 6\n\n-------------------------------\nOverall:\n\nI'd definitely recommend this case to anyone who wants something different and is currently looking at the reviews to see if they'd want it or not. Just do it you doughnut; I did and I have no regrets... well except the mounting screws, but that's not gonna stop me from enjoying this brilliant case"

Nothing cheap here, great construction, designed for easy cable management, 4 USB 3.2 ports (Type A) and 1 Type C in the front. 2 control buttons: 1 for the LED lights and 1 for the fans, making this super convenient if you don't want to open your app to adjust them.\n\nThe design makes it easy to built your computer, whether you're using an ATX or EATX board. Still using SATA Hard-Disk, all bays are hidden at the bottom of the casing.\n\nOne little \"heads-up\" on the size of the case, having space for EATX boards makes it bigger than most. Not dramatically bigger though. The extra space makes it easier to install components like a watercooler; additionally big fingers can do perfect cable management. Finally, this quality case is also heavier than most but with the 2 side and front panels made of tempered glass, it can't be light.\n\nAfter building gaming computers for more than 20 years, this is the best casing I ever had."

        "review": "Used this for my latest build and it’s one of the nicest cases I’ve used to date. Very solid case and well thought out design right down to the horizontal GPU braced. It does come set-up for a vertical GPU but you’ll need to order a very expensive riser cable which is almost double the price of any other riser cable I’ve used. I’m using an Asus Thor 850W RGB PSU and the basement is made for it with a nice window to view the OLED Live-dash panel. It really would be a loss not to use an Asus THOR PSU with this case. It’s kind of a neat idea, designing a case with the top straps made to carry it... but you’d need a couple Sherpas if you plan to go far. It comes with a fan controller but I think these are really an outdated concept and I never actually use them. It also comes with fans, typically I use my own and I have a large supply of unused fans.\n\nPro’s\n-solid construction\n-designed to transport\n-everything lines up\n-fan hub\n-4 fans included\n\nCon’s\n-Heavy\n-expensive\n-no riser cable included\n-four more fans\n\nConclusion\nI’m very happy with this case, it is a good purchase even at the premium price point. It would have been nice for it to include that expensive riser cable. It would be nice if Asus kept their fans and controller, but instead included the riser cable."

BUT everything on that case is tempered glass EXCEPT the PSU shroud cut out that is made of avrylic. And mine came pretty scratched from the inside, right where the oled display from my ROG Thor PSU will fit... will check with the seller and Asus to see what can be done. Until then, can't say anything about building in it since i repacked everything and on old before starting my build. Will update to 5 star if the issue is resolved."

Also, something I had to research and found out how because the I couldn't control the ARGB in the software. if you want to use the PC software's to connect your ARGB hub/controller you will need to do this once on the desktop. Hold the RGB button at the top of the case until it flashes a quick double after 5/10 seconds. Now you will be able to control it trough the ASUS AURA or other software's.\n\n- Another issue with the ASUS and case and controller, is that if you chose Corsair RAMS like me and you don't chose RGB RAMS that is not compatible with the ASUS AURA software is that you now have to use two software's that are not compatible. ASUS AURA and Corsair iCUE are not compatible, but there is a small fix. Install the latest two software's and after that find (CorsairPluginForAuraSync_2.0.30) plugins. It's hard to find and the newest versions does not work so use this specific version. After you have installed all 3, now go in iCUE and in the RAM settings now un-click the (Enable full software control) and rest the iCUE service in the bottom button. now the RAM will show up in the AURA software,\n\nAt the moment I don't have any other CONS or things that makes it bad. That's why I like it."

        "review": "I picked this up last week because I was tired of my old case which was dirty, dented, and dingy. I actually got this one \"used-excellent\" for $10 less and total cost was $100 (Canadian) after taxes. Why am I mentioning the price? Well...\n\nThe only reference I saw to the need for an SFX power supply was in a comment someone made - it's not (clearly) anywhere in the description or specs. So - when I took my old pc apart (which - with the exception of the case - had been fully upgraded in November) and started to put things in, I discovered that the ATX power supply I had was never going to fit. \"SFX required\" said that earlier-mentioned comment, so I went back to Amazon . ca and looked for one. Yeah, the cheapest one I could find was just over $200. Fine - it was a decent power supply, 80+ gold rated with a 7 year warranty, so i got it. I waited till the next day to continue the build and discovered much to my disappointment that the cpu liquid cooler i had for my previous PC was too big - and it was only a single fanned one - so off I trot to Amazon *again* to find a low-profile cpu fan. $76 and a day later, I have my CPU fan.\n\nIn case anyone's thinking \"this guy's an idiot - why would he expect his old pc components to fit in an mini-ITX case???\" - well, this idiot's previous set up was also a mini-ITX - it was just a different shape (more of a cube) so bigger things fit. Thankfully - my RTX 3060 fit just fine...except I can't put any fans underneath it on the bottom of the case, but that's fine, I have enough fans for now.\n\nHaving said all this, my verdict is that this is a really well built little case, very solid, there were enough screws and bits for whatever setup i needed, and while the instructions seemed a bit confusing at first, it was just because there were so many options for set up. This really is a beautiful case and I don't regret any of the required purchases - I just hate surprise expenses - but in the end, it was totally worth it.\n\nThe whole thing is now together, I have"

        "review": "Pros:\n- The white model looks extremely clean and minimalist.\n- All panels can be removed, along with most (all?) of the internal brackets. If you have difficulty building computers because of the lack of room to work, then this is the perfect case for you.\n- There is two locations for the SFX power supply, allowing you to use wider (244mm) and taller (up to 226mm) motherboard. However this feature is practically pointless (see below).\n\nThe problem:\n- Most mini-ITX motherboards cost at least the same price if not 25 to 50% higher than micro-ATX boards, you end up paying a lot more for less features (ex: 2 RAM slots instead of 4, only one M.2 instead of two, etc).\n- The selection of mini-ITX motherboards is also extremely limited compared to mATX.\n- While this case was specifically made for mini-ITX and three-slots-wide GPUs, this case should in theory also fit 3-slots micro-ATX motherboards. The problem is that 3-slots-tall micro-ATX motherboards are basically impossible to find depending on your CPU.\n- If only they made this case one slot taller, it would also have been compatible with mATX motherboards. IMHO it's already way too big to be classified as a small form factor case, so what's one more slot in height?\n\nTL;DR: if you're thinking about buying this case, make sure you complete your parts list and check that everything will fit. After over a week of futile research for 226mm or shorter mATX motherboards for LGA 1700, I'm regretting buying this case even though it is the most beautiful case I've ever owned."

        "review": " This NR200P is fairly easy to work with as majority of the panels are removable for easy access; I did not have any issues installing a CPU cooler while the motherboard was pre-installed and I did end up using an EVGA SFX power supply for this system. Majority of the work is tucking in all the necessary cabling for the power supply which is assisted by the velcro straps on the power supply bracket.\n\nI chose this case as it has a fairly small footprint and comes with a glass side panel that can be customized with a few vinyl decals; I appreciate that there is a pcie 3.0 riser cable for vertical GPU mounting and two black Cooler Master PWM fans included. I didn't end up using a lot of the accessories included with this case and I don't plan on swapping out the configuration too often; I am using M.2 storage drives exclusively as my ITX motherboard supports two NVMe SSDs and the case has a nice large cutout for easy access to the back of the motherboard.\n\nSince this case does not have a USB-C front panel port, you can definitely opt for more affordable mini ITX motherboard options that do not have an internal USB-C Gen 2 front panel connector. I did end up re-routing most of the front panel connection cables behind the metal front panel to keep things clean; It is a challenge to integrate RGB fans with a controller as you may need to sacrifice a 2.5 inch drive mounting point.\n\nTemperatures are good once you populate the top and bottom with 120mm fans; 31 degrees idle so far with an NH-L12s cooler and an RGB fan. Since there is an i5 10400f inside, this 65w CPU is thermally manageable in this case and I don't plan to do any overclocking. There is plenty of dust filtration to keep it clean inside.\n\nOverall, I feel there is a lot of excess case parts when finally completing the build process and I am not sure if can find a use for them. It's a beautiful case with the glass panel; You really need to do some research and see what restrictions there are for component sizing. It may be difficult to fit a custom cable extension kit as there is very little room to tuck excess cabling."

        "review": "Una gran opción que te permite tener un equipo completo en un espacio reducido. El metal es resistente y no se dobla con facilidad. Tiene rejas en las tapas laterales y permite colocar una MB mATX de las pequeñas y posiblemente una PSU de tamaño normal colgándola con los cinturones de velcro incluídos. También cabe una GPU de hasta 3 ventiladores pero hay que tener cuidado con las medidas antes de comprar la GPU para asegurar que quepa."

        "review": "This review is for Cooler Master NR200P White SFF Small Form Factor Mini-ITX Case\n\nI love this PC case. It's big enough to use large air coolers and large graphics cards, but it doesn't take over your whole desk. I especially like how you can take off the side panels and bottom when you are assembling your PC. It makes it so easy to access all the components and route your cables. I like this case so much that I bought an extra one when it was on sale, just in case a friend wanted me to build them a computer or something."

        "review": "This is an excellent case, and one of the few mainstream and affordable small form factor PC cases. Its major relative compromise is the size, which is close to as large as \"SFF\" gets. The case is also heavier than most SFF cases, being mostly made of steel, versus aluminum or plastic. However, it has nearly no size or cooling limitations in its class. Aesthetically, it follows the general SFF PC trend of minimalist design. Anything I have planned for my build, be it the largest GPU I can afford, or adding some old 3.5\" hard drives to my system, are possible in this case, which is easily transportable, though not quite backpack portable. I won't spend much time talking more about the positives of this case but I'll highlight some of my gripes, which should not be deal breakers, but ways that Cooler Master can improve the case without reducing its capabilities.\n\nThough the NR200 can accommodate almost any ITX hardware, its layout design is not completely perfect. I would have appreciated some gaps in the frame or motherboard area for routing cables behind the motherboard. One of my PSU cables is routed between the motherboard panel and the case's right side panel (when looking towards the case), but it's the flat kind which raises the case's side panel ever so slightly. Others with round or quality braided cables looking to route their cables behind the motherboard without raising the side case panel will need to route the cables in the gap between the motherboard and the motherboard panel. Unfortunately, they will need to do this before installing the motherboard, and uninstall the mobo every time before disconnecting. Some extra spaces or gaps that allow the cable connectors to slide through would have solved this problem. Another gap for the 24 pin connector would have improved quality of life a little, too, though I'm not sure if that would be possible in a practical spot. Having the thick 24 pin cable extending from the PSU in its default position can press down on the GPU without some careful cable management. Fortunately, Cooler Master provided some velcro straps underneath the PSU that help with this a lot, likely because they anticipated this problem for most consumers. Still, I can tell that Cooler Master intended this case to be as easy as possible for beginners, and neat cable management and avoiding pressure on the GPU will likely be a fairly difficult step of building in this case. Finally, the case could perhaps use some lengthier front I/O cables, so that they could have been routed behind the motherboard without blocking the PSU fan.\n\nSpeaking of front I/O, I would have also preferred a USB type C connector on the front. I can understand that it was not included due to cost, but I would prefer a version of the NR200 with a type C port and no fans, and likely would have even paid $10 more for that tradeoff. My version of the NR200 is the base version which comes with one 92mm fan and one 120mm fan, and the included fans are fine; not exceptionally quiet but not annoyingly loud. Still, I might replace both of them with Noctua fans to get the quietest possible airflow, and the 92mm fan will definitely not fit when I upgrade to the CPU cooler I plan on getting. Though Cooler Master included fans to appeal to customers who will use stock coolers and don't want to worry about aftermarket cooling solutions, they still have an opportunity to cater to more enthusiast consumers (who constitute a large part of the SFF community). Many SFF builders will either not need the included fans, or prefer to choose their own. They likely also prefer having near to mid-term future proof features. A version of this case without fans and a type C port, offered at a small premium, would still be a great deal.\n\nMy unit also came with a minor defect - the metal frame (not sure of the correct term) of one of the USB ports at the top is not completely connected. The end of the metal frame is bent inwards slightly as shown in the picture. I haven't encountered problems while plugging and unplugging USB devices, albeit carefully, into the jack multiple times over the past couple of weeks, so I didn't deduct a star or try to get it replaced. I'm optimistic that it'll stay as-is and not get bent worse over time. If this is a problem in manufacturing, hopefully Cooler Master can address this issue."

        "review": "This case is awesome, well designed, well made. This was my first computer build, and my son, who has some experience, questioned my decision to go with the NR200P given the additional challenge of working in a small space--until he saw it in person. He was so impressed, he wanted one for himself.\n\nHere is my build:\n\nIntel Core i7-12700K\nASUS ROG Strix B660-I (mini-ITX)\nNvidia RTX 3070FE GPU\nKingston Fury Beast DDR5 16 x 2 RAM (rgb)\nEVGA Supernova 750W SFX power supply (note small form factor)\nSK Hynix Platinum P41 2 TB m.2 SSD\nSK Hynix Platinum P41 1 TB m.2 SSD\nThermalright Silver Soul 135 white cooler\nArctic P9 PWM PST 92mm fan\nArctic BioniX F120 fans x 2\nChassis fan hub CPU Cooling (the really cryptic looking one)\n\nNoteworthy: The Thermalright cooler DOES fit, even with the glass side. Actually has some room to spare.\n\nThe Kingston RAM has only about 2mm clearance from the cooling tower. But 2mm is enough.\n\nMy fan hub sits behind the front panel, nicely hidden, because it's not pretty. I routed several things behind that panel. You can also place SSDs there, but mine are both m.2, directly plugged into the MB, so that front panel was wide open for wires.\n\nI added two fans on the bottom and one at the back. Based on my review of the \"literature\" (YouTube), the best airflow with a cooling tower is to intake from the bottom and back, and exhaust thru the top. Including the fan in the center of my cooling tower, I have 6 fans in here and no problems with heat. The two stock fans are on top, and [update alert] a year later, they're still working flawlessly. I did add a magnetic filter on the back to block off the openings back there since I'm intaking air thru all those openings at the back. Technically, it's not held there by magnets. The tab from the case top holds it in place perfectly. My computer sits right next to an air filter which sits right next to a chinchilla cage, with hair and dust floating everywhere.\n______________________________________\n\nEveryone talks about the challenge of routing the cables in such a small case. For me, this was the fun part and I was very happy with the outcome. Like I said, I'm a first time builder, so I have no experience. Which means you can do it too. You can decide based on the pics whether you think I did a decent enough job.\n\nPut together a second NR200P system to surprise my dad. He didn't need a dedicated GPU, or rgb RAM, but otherwise the builds were pretty similar, and it went equally well. LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors, too! I would've gone with pink if it hadn't been $50 more at the time of my build. Still kinda wish I had, because pink is my color. But the white looks really nice too.\n\nTwo great experiences with this case! Highly recommended."

        "review": "I previously owned a Corsair H100iv2 CPU liquid cooler with idle temps of 19-25C, under max load 45C, 2hr stress test 52C. With the Noctua NH-U125 that I currently have installed 28-31C idle temps, under max load 50C, 2hr stress test 65C. At Noctua $94.95(CAD) vs Corsair $124.99(CAD) you get what you pay for. The price seems fair for its performance. Honestly, if you can expense a water cooler and trust having one in your build then I'd just go for it. If not, then this definitely would not be a bad start for an CPU air cooler.\n\n*This is a 2nd review after ordering a 2nd fan for my Noctua NH-U125. I am now saying if you're going to get this CPU air cooler, order the 2nd fan with it as well!. Also, I figured if I could spend close to $150 for a Corsair liquid cooler for \"bEsT PeRfoRmAnCe\" then why not do the same for my Noctua?. Plus, you will not be upset with the performance! I can actually say I am happy with my overall purchase!. Idle temps 29-30C, casual load (e.x checking email, watching YouTube, surfing web) 30-31C, under heavy load (gaming, streaming, discord, music, etc.) 45-50C, 2h stress test 60-62C. I should also clarify or make sense to my previous post where I said \"max load\". I should've said \"heavy load\" as my \"max loads\" would've actually been the stress test temps. So, Noctua NH-U125 $94.95CAD + Noctua NF- F12 cooling fan $33.16CAD = $128.11CAD (before taxes) for the same performance as or better in some cases than a liquid cooler was a good purchase.\n\nNotes:\nNoise level is quiet. Much quieter than my previous liquid cooler or liquid coolers I've came across.\nI run my fans at 64% which is around or little over 1200RPM on my front fan and 1500RPM on my back fan. I am comfortable with that as I receive desired/reasonable temps . (Note: Temps do spike and goes right back to its actual temp, but that's normal of a CPU to do that.)\nI am a believer that ambient temperature affects CPU temps so I keep a window cracked about 4-5 feet away from my pc so its keeps the room cool and fresh air gets in. In the winter, I feel its a plus when the room gets cold as my temps are rock solid at times (I start to think my pc froze, lol).\nOverall the best purchase you can make on a CPU air cooler. I would now even rule out getting a liquid cooler if you can purchase this with a 2nd fan."

        "review": "Purchased this because I was unhappy with the temperatures my R9 3900x was sitting at with the stock Wraith Prism cooler. I couldn't decide between this and the NH-D15 (and D15S variant which is identical but with a single fan for $10 less). Eventually went with this U12S and am quite satisfied. I'm sure the D15 would outperform this cooler slightly, but it's also quite a bit bulkier and this seems to do just fine cooling a 3900x with Precision Boost Overdrive enabled.\n\nIt was pretty expensive for a tower cooler but I trust the reliability and build quality of this a lot more than an equally priced AIO water cooler, and in black it is pretty good looking if a little understated. I threw on a cheap Fractal Design Silent 120mm fan to pull air off, with the included Noctua fan pushing, and my temps dropped about 10-15 degrees to a much more comfortable zone.\n\nWraith Prism -\n50-65 @ idle\n85 - 90 @ stress test\n\nNoctua NH-U12S -\n35 - 50 @ idle\n70 - 80 @ stress test\n\nI didn't choose this for noise, but it's definitely quieter than the stock Prism cooler at equivalent load.\n\nMounting was relatively easy. I had difficulty aligning the actual cooler with the brackets and screwing it on, took a couple tries and smeared my thermal paste around but it did eventually seat itself and the installation was \"easy\", just took a bit of time to get right. Didn't even have to take the motherboard out of the case.\n\nNote that this while this does come with the mounting hardware to accommodate an extra fan, it does not come with a splitter cable, so if you want to add a second fan to the cooler you will need to get one, or you can just plug the extra fan into a free motherboard case fan header. I had a Noctua splitter laying around from a previous build so I went that route."

        "review": "I needed a new cooler for my ASUS Z390 TUF-Gaming Plus WIFI ATX motherboard since I lost the mounting plates for previous cooler (switched from AMD to Intel CPU). I heard the Noctua fans were really quiet and like everyone else I really can't stand that brown color. The backplate for the classic EVO 212 was too tall for my case (Elite 430)- again typical problems with EVO 212 just being such an awkward size for so many systems. Thought I'd give this a try because it looks awesome and have heard good things, and the price seemed reasonable.\n\nNot only did the NH-U12S backplate fit just fine, it was far easier to install than the D92 I had previously. It fits perfectly and the instructions were fairly straight forward, with lots of guides online to help guide me.\n\nThe fan is remarkably quiet I honestly thought my previous fans were quiet but I'm going to be replacing every fan in my system now with Noctua (if I can find black) or something similar. It keeps the CPU very cool and even when it picks up at full RPM its very quiet - and I'm not even using the like adapter PWM switch it came with (which allegedly makes it even quieter).\n\nHonestly this CPU cooler looks awesome and works awesome and was almost a joy to install (took me a while, but half of that was figuring out how to use the thermal paste LOL - twist the black cap - use pliers (carefully) if you need better grip). Only complaint is that I wish it came with a second fan so I could have the push / pull arranagement - it does come with the extra clip though so you can easily attach another fan - I just want all black instead of the antique signature brown lol)\n\n5/5 would buy again. Looks almost apple-esque if you add a matching all black push fan."

( processeur boosté a 4.20GHZ ) aie aie aie sa commence a piqué...mais se n'est rien car cela dure qu'au lancement des applications et sa se stabilise assez vite pour une température général a 48 degrés ( sur le bureau oui oui , j’espérais mieux... )\nSur Apex Legends j’obtiens une température entre 54 et...71 !! le pic ici est légèrement trop a mon gout mais sa se stabilise généralement vers 65 degrés....\nSur The Witcher 3 j’obtiens une température entre 53 et 69 avec une température général de 59...ici ça va rien de méchant non plus.\n\nMais la différence entre le watercooling L240 en push pull que j'ai aussi placé sur la config AMD est aussi peu flagrante , le watercooling s'en sors avec des températures légèrement moins élevé mais mon L360mm ( un très très gros watercooling donc , explose littéralement le Noctua coté stabilité et pic de chaleur )\n\nPourtant d'une marque peu connus ( Deepcool ) on m'avais dit que les watercooling de marque comme deepcool n'avais rien avoir avec les meilleur ventirad du marché et bien...d'après les test c'est faux !\n\nConclusion , une solution a air sera totalement compatible et gérable sur une config optimisé Intel mais chez AMD je préfère très largement la solution watercooling qui finalement d'après les \"on-dit\" n'est pas la uniquement pour faire jolie.\n\nje comptais remplacer mon L360 de ma config AMD étant ma config principal mais finalement je l'ai mise dans ma config intel car je préfère la stabilité et la fraicheur de mon L360 dans ma config AMD.\n\n( je tient a dire que dans se test le ventirad Noctua ne fait aucun bruit poussé a fond et qu'il était régler a fond constamment durant ces test c'est a dire 1500rpm environ )\n\nDonc si c'est pour jouer uniquement sur une config intel et faire un overclock léger vous pouvez y aller mais si c'est pour du montage poussé/3D avec du AMD n'y penser pas...sa sera correcte mais sur de longue années le processeur va encaisser et ne pas aimer donc préféré les solutions Watercooling chez AMD.\n\nFinalement monter sur un 9600k après plusieurs mois d'utilisation la qualité est irréprochable , je remonte la note d'une étoile , j'adore vraiment la simplicité de cette marque incroyable.\n\nEdit : Finalement c'est normal pour AMD, leur processeur conduit largement moins bien la chaleur au \"die\" a cause de leur trop large capsule, donc non, il reste cependant très performant sur du Intel qui eux n'ont pas ce soucis."

        "review": "The metal on this case is soft. The front mesh arrived dented from shipping. The styrofoam is hard so that transferred the pressure when the box was being dropped. The perforated psu shroud door and the two shroud top covers are flimsy soft and has lots of flex. The cable management bar is no different. It's a heavy case since almost everything is made of metal aside from the upper/lower part of the front grill, hdd sleds and psu dust cover.\n\nThe swinging glass doors are nice features but the back side near the motherboard tray is unnecessary. The metal cable covers are already covering the managed cables so there's no point. The glass panels has no handle so the bottom doors need to be opened before the it can be accessed. The three pre installed rgb fans use non-standard plugs. The means the rgb buttons on the case can't control other rgb fans if the original fan fails or the whole fans needs to be swapped out for a different brand."

Couple this with excellent compartments and cable ties to also promote clean cable management, and the ability to customise the case internals to make space or move things around is another bonus.

        "review": "I haven't even begun my build yet and have already found a problem with this case. My intent was to put a 360mm rad on both the top and side but there is absolutely no way the side mounts will take a 360mm rad.\n\nUpdate:\nIf you plan to water cool your gpu then you will almost definitely need to mount it vertically. I attempted to mount mine normally but the waterblock stuck out by about 1/2\" too far to put the side back on the case.\n\nThe front glass panel, although designed to be removeable, can't be removed. The top part of the case overhangs the top edge of it preventing it from being removed. Although this doesn't affect the function of the case it does make it a little more difficult to build in it by limiting access.\n\nThere are six passthroughs for cables however only two have any protection on the edges. This means the protective case on the wires can be cut through quite easily while you pull them through. The two larger ones (with protection) are just a little too small.\n\nThe mobo sits very low in this case. If you put a rad and fans, or even just fans, on the bottom then the lower edge of and ATX mobo would be covered making plugging anything in along that edge difficult.\n\nCable management consists of \"stuff it in the back and cover it up\". There are no tiedown spots like are often found it better cases.\n\nOverall: While I was able to do (almost) what I wanted to do in this case it wasn't easy. There is lots of room for improvement."

Front has a small gap between the fans and the front glass, the pics show this being enclosed. Both rubber gromets are barely on the case and pull through as soon as you tough them.

Building in the case feels constrained as some areas where it is awkward to route cables. The motherboard sits extremely low to the bottom of the case and leaves minimal space to get cables to the bottom of the case. The limited amount of holes are made worse with how small the openings are and it's difficult to pass multiple cables through. The case has a generous amount of space in the back which makes cable managing easier, especially with the space for 10 fans."

They are much better instructions than what I've found with cheaper CPU coolers. This is also a surprisingly large CPU cooler considering that Noctua sells even bigger ones. It is actually a pretty high-end cooler compared to other brands and will be more than adequate for all but the most avid gamers and overclockers. It is more than good enough for average to high-end use. Another nice feature is that it supports a wide variety of CPU sockets right out of the box. Not only does that mean you can use it on a range of today's CPUs, but if you ever upgrade there's a good chance you'll be able to use it on your next CPU too."

Not about to write a full essay but if you need decent cooling for a stronger CPU with a decent sized fan I highly suggest this. Went with the black and white touch in photo & video attached and will plan to keep upgrading with more fans over time. Hope this helps for someone who is unsure, highly rated and highly suggested for guaranteed satisfaction. Make it go brrr to keep that CPU cooled down. 🥶❄️"

        "review": "Since I have my PC, I always used the original Intel CPU Cooler included with my i5-4590. The fan has always been a bit noisy, especially when pushing the CPU. At idle, temp was around 35°C, but as soon as I was pushing the CPU, temp was reaching easily 70-75°C and the fan was giving the impression that it was going to come out of the case. I replaced the thermal paste 2 times with no effect.\n\nSince I replace the cooler, the difference is striking. At idle, temp is 2-3°C lower ,which is not a lot, but the fan is so silent that I though it was not spinning. And when pushing the CPU, temp is at least 15°C lower. For now, after 3 weeks, the max temp I have reached is 55°C. I can hear the fan spinning like a slight hum, but the noise is a little bit less loud than my original Intel fan at idle.\n\nInstallation is pretty easy. With my Zalman Z1 case (not the Neo), no need to remove the motherboard to fix the support for the cooler. The trickiest part was to reinstall the fan on the cooler after fixing it on the motherboard. In my opinion, this is the biggest flaw, which is not so big when you consider the gain. The way to clip the fan to the cooler could be improved, but that's it."

        "review": "Works great with my ryzen 5 3600. Considerably better than the stock AMD cooler. The AMD stock cooler kept my processor around 80-85°C with all cores at 100% usage, or \"under a full load\". The Noctua NHU9S kept my processor around 70°C consistently under a full load. While that may seem like a small difference, and both numbers also might sound really hot to some of you, the noctua cooler keeps the cpu right in the middle of the 65-75°C maximum temperature that I myself and other tech enthusiasts usually recommend. Even though the max temp of the cpu is technically higher than that, up to 110°C sometimes, I still dont recommend pushing it that far if you want system stability, and in some cases you can even kill your cpu by reaching those extremely high temperatures . If you're planning on doing a ridiculous level of overclocking, this cooler isn't for you. But for a gaming computer or even a workstation running at stock speeds or even some light to moderate overclocking, this cpu cooler, for me at least, hits the sweet spot of price to performance."

I had less than half an inch to spare once I had it mounted. I had to use a custom mounting with special screws as taking the motherboard out of my case and mounting a backplate was not really an option for me. That being said the quality of the fan and heat ink are top notch. Made a huge difference in my cpu temperature in stress tests and in gaming applications. They provide you with all you need to mount to an AMD or intel chip set board. Just make sure it fits, and you have the right socket etc, and you are golden. Great product, would buy it or other Noctua products in a future PC build."

Elegí este porque es de los pocos que caben en esta torre tan pequeña. El pc está muy bien en general pero venía flojo de refrigeración de fábrica, aunque con cooler máster. En cualquier cosa algo más exigente se ponía el procesador a 89-90°, eso es una barbaridad, rozando el límite ya. Después de poner noctua, desde el primer momento, los mismos programas y juegos de antes, mismas características, 25-30° menos que antes, de momento (3 días) ha llegado máximo a 65 °. Eso es la ostia de bajada de temperatura. Me sorprendí para bien, pero que vamos. Esperaba alguna mejora pero tanto ni imaginaba. Y luego el montaje super fácil. Ni siquiera fue necesario desmontar la placa de Acer. Fue desmontar el viejo, mirar las partes que venían para mí placa (1200lga en mi caso, pero ahí partes y para otros - 1700lx, amd, etc...) y probé 2-3 variantes de montaje sin quitar la placa y colocar el soporte que viene en la caja de atras. Total, en 5 min aprovechando el soporte de fábrica coloque las placas y tornillos necesarios para sujetar el disipador, un poco de pasta térmica después de limpiar el procesador de la vieja (ah, dentro de la caja viene una jeringuilla con pata térmica de la marca noctua, solo eso vale 10 euros, así que un detallazo!), apretar las dos tuercas con muelles para que reparten la pasta y se unan bien el radiador con el procesador, colocar el ventilador y enchufarlo y au. A funcionar. La verdad que una maravilla."

The AF 120RGB Fans alone (3x) alone would cost around $150~ alone. If you can get this case on sale, I would definitely hop on it. The price was amazing during Prime Day.\n\nLets get into the pros of this case:\n\n1. The airflow of this case is great. Has plenty of room and space for air to escape.\n2. There's a usb-c port on the front I/O which some people may find handy. Although, this depends entirely on your motherboard.\n3. Vertical mount GPU applicable. You can mount your GPU vertically if you'd prefer as it comes with a vertical bracket.\n4. Tempered glass panel for that clean look. If you're into that RGB look, this would be a no brainer of a case to display that RGB.\n5. Comes with straps at the back for easy cable management.\n\nCons:\n1.Of course with better airflow, it may be noisy for some as the case is not known to suppress the fans that well. This of course, depends on the fans you use.\n2. There is only one USB Port in the front I/O. I would ideally wish they added at least 2 USB ports instead of one.\n\nOverall, if you can get the case for a good price, I would definitely hop on it. If this is your first build, this case is pretty beginner friendly as well."

This thing is deeper than what I need as Im mostly using it for audio equipment but my PC is mounted in it with loads of space. It also benefits from being able to mount stuff on both sides of the rack.\nIm not a fan of the feet, opting not to use them because im on carpet, or the little bits that stick out on the bottom. Aside from that it's relatively heavy but seems indestructible."

I have worked with a few higher end racks that are closed concept, (in the $1000 range) and this rack is giving those a run for their money.\nThe rack is great for people that don't plan on buying in bulk, (I'm talking 100's) but still want to leave room to expand to a few more of these.\nThe rack comes with ALL the components, screws, and tools to get set up.\nI personally rack-mounted my 24 port switch, as well as 2 servers, and it's amazing what I found out about this rack.\nIt came with the screws that my switch failed to come with to rack mount the thing, as well as the screwdriver to get them tightened, which not many products do nowadays.\nThe rack comes with wheels for operating, or bolts so that you can bolt it into the floor, the wheels are pretty sturdy for my use.\nPutting it together was quite a task, but fun nonetheless\n\nWhat else can I say, this rack does exactly what it should and is great quality, with an amazing price tag. Probably one of the best things I've purchased from Amazon."

        "review": "I had been considering the 8U version of this same rack for quite some time, but when Prime day rolled around, this 12U unit was actually on sale for less than the 8U rack. So I took the plunge because I needed a place to set up a renewed Dell R710 server.\n\nIt comes with a lot of nice extras that show StarTech has put more effort into its units than most of the knock-offs. It's made of very sturdy, powder coated steel. I really appreciate that it came with *all* of the tools that you will need to put it together -- including 2 wrenches and a Philips screwdriver. The instructions are well written and come in a nice little plastic pouch should you need them again. More than enough hardware included as well.\n\nBe sure to measure your server before putting this together. I ended up going about six inches longer because of the measurements listed in the manual. Measure the mounting hardware of your server and make sure you get within a few inches of the fully-expanded rack-mounting. It wasn't too tough to adjust the size, though.\n\nIt works well with a Dell R710 server (see photo) and I plan to add beneath and possibly a fan/power-strip. It's supposed to be able to hold 1200 pounds and that's probably true. I'm not sure how easy it would be to move with that much weight. It's pretty hefty and the addition of a huge server makes it tough enough to move already. But it's not made to be mobile all the time. It's a good way to get things set up and put it in a cool closet when you are done.\n\nI'm happy with this and I'd definitely buy from StarTech again. The quality is much better than what I expected. Solid 5 stars."

The StarTech rack seemed like a better options than many others I viewed. Since it was on sale I pulled the trigger and glad I did.\n\nThis rack is well designed and was easy to assemble with just myself. I was able to put it together in about an hour and start loading components. With heavy amps installed low it was actually easier to lay the rack on it's back and load those first then stand it up. Everything fit well and the hardware worked well for assembly and loading equipment.\n\nThis beast really can hold a ton of equipment and i was even able to install my large switch on the back since components can be installed on either side. I purchased several velcro straps and the wide open angled vertical posts were perfect for running cables. I do recommend laying out all your components in s spreadsheet before ordering a rack and the extra filler plates you might need.\n\nI ended up knocking off one star as it has a slight in lean from bottom to top since it is holding very heavy equipment. It is still stable and this is not a big deal but I will most likely end up installing some cables and turnbuckles on each side to pull it back into square."

        "review": "I've only had this for about a week or two, but so far:\n- It arrived in good condition and quickly\n- PC setup in the case was very easy\n- Cable management is great. Most cables can be hidden i the case behind the motherboard. There are areas all over for routing cables and securing them.\n- The three fans that came with the case are all VERY quiet and move a ton of air. I have a high end gaming system, and a motherboard that supports liquid cooling, but I've gone with an air cooled setup.\n- There is a lot of space in this case. I was able to attach a massive BeQuiet heatsink to the CPU with room to spare.\n- So far temps in the case have been cool. No heat issues.\n- It's also a very nice looking case, and solidly built.\n\n- the only negative so far is that the ARGB lights on the lower front fan do not work unless I open the case and wiggle the connector for those lights. The female connector on the cable from the fan has holes that are just a bit too large. While the upper fan's ARGB connector is snug and works well. That lower fan works fine otherwise though.\nI've put in a request with Cooler Master to replace the lower fan as per their instructions to me. I'm just waiting on them to proceed with that ticket. But as that fan works fine for moving air (it's main function), I'm not in any rush. And they were very quick with their responses to my inquiries.\n\nGiven my experience with Cooler Master so far, I would not hesitate to buy from them again."

        "review": "Coming from a Silverstone FT02, the MC H500 is not in the same quality range and this is also reflected with the price.\nI was shopping for a new case because I found out that my new EVGA RTX 3080 FTW3 didn't like to be installed vertically (10C higher temperature).\nSo, I began to look for a case that uses large fans because I was using 180mm fans since 2009 and really liked them.\nStumble across this H500 case with a mesh front, looked at it and thought that my new AP183 fans would fit.\nUpon receiving the case and without testing the original fans 200mm, I proceed to cut out the front and installed my AP183 fans. It must be noted that doing so erase any possibilities of using 120/140mm fans in the future.\nWith the AP183 installed, the case performs beautifully in the noise and the cooling department.\nThe bottom 180mm fan is also perfectly aligned to feed fresh air to the GPU, which is not the case with the new Fractal Torrent case, for example. Also, with the use of the AP183 (and their special airflow pattern), at medium speed (around 800rpm), you can feel fresh air going to the last fan of the GPU. You also don't feel any hot air coming from the GPU and recirculating back into it.\nPoint to be noted, the GPU temperatures are better (around 2-3C) without the PSU shroud.\nFinally, I really like how this case/project turned out, some work was needed, but it now performs beautifully.\nI hope that my review can help some that are hesitant and would like to use their beloved 180mm fans."

        "review": "Plenty of space inside to work, cable management is a snap, I have two complaints however.\n\nOne: There is no instruction manual - neither a physical one or one on Cooler Masters website - which would have made figuring out some of the rgb connectors a little easier.\n\nTwo: What genius thought up these harddrive bays? There's only two, and if you have a full size multimedia HDD you can either put it in the tray but not be able to place the pins in because the harddrive is in the way OR you can leave the pins in and not be able to get your harddrive in because the pins are in the way!\n\nIt LOOKS like you're supposed to put the harddrive in the tray, then put the pins on and slide it into a locked position, but this is impossible without somehow magically shrinking your harddrive, putting the pins in, and then magically expanding your harddrive because the sliding locks are inverse to each other!\n\nI don't know, maybe an INSTRUCTION MANUAL could have cleared up my confusion or at least had the incantation I needed to recite to make it work as intended. In the end, I took some screws from my toolkit and screwed the HDD in the old fashioned way and sure enough, that worked. Please stop trying to reinvent the wheel guys."

BUT I've been using this case with no airflow problems, my cpu runs about 50C and my gpu around the same, I haven't overclocked or adjusted anything ( other then turning off the 0 rpm thing for the gpu) soo great case! It just bothers me that the fans seemed to be a last minute thought for this case and no adjustments where made, it would be nice to see another version that gives you a diffrent mount for the fans (like how you have the choice of metal mesh or plastic window in the box) that would fit the bigger fans"

        "review": "I'm a fan girl of NZXT's towers and was planning another NZXT-based build. I decided, however, to try something new, something that would be different from my regular builds. Cue in this Cooler Master H500.\n\nIt has been nothing short of amazing. If you'd like the \"short and sweet\" bulleted points, then just read this part, otherwise I've written a lot of information.\n- a total of up to x6 (if solely using) 120mm fans, x4 (if solely using) 140mm fans, or x3 (if solely using) 200mm fans\n- a front mesh panel that captures dust; there is also an optional acrylic panel that can be used instead if preferred (more on this later)\n- tempered glass panel that has two screws that cannot be taken off (so it's no longer easy to misplace). The glass panel also has hinges at the bottom so it won't accidentally fall and shatter, etc\n- supports ATX, mATX, or miniATX builds\n- has x2 M.2 slots, x2 3.5\" hard drive bays (an additional mount can be purchased to support 4 more), and x4 2.5\" SSD bays. 2 SSD's can be mounted on the right side of the case with little plugs, therefore offering a tool-less assembly). The HDD drive bay can also be removed if you just plan on only using the 2 SSD mounts\n- in regards to cable management, there is a vertical bar with rubberized routing holes. This is removable if you prefer a more spacious build\n- x2 200mm CoolerMaster MasterFan 200R RGB fans installed in the front panel and 1 generic 120mm fan\n- a removable PSU cover\n- 3 dust filter covers (for the top, front and bottom of the case)\n- a vertical GPU mount (riser cable not included)\n- multiple zip ties in order to manage the cables inside (among other small things)\n\nSo, I won't be able to touch on everything, as I don't use the vertical GPU mount for starters, but I can give insight on other aspects. First off, this case comes with many fan placement options. For reference, I have x2 120mm fans up top, x1 120mm fan in the back, and x2 200mm fans up front. I currently have Corsair SP LL120 RGB's and they work great paired with the CoolerMaster fans. Side note, if you are in the market for the Corsair SP LL120 RGB's and would like it to pulse, breath, or mimic the 200mm fans, then you'll need to purchase the CORSAIR iCUE Commander PRO Controller.\n\nAnyway, the case does come with a handy magnetic dust filter for the top of the case (fan area). 1 month later and I can tell that it is definitely doing its job. The front of the case has another mesh like structure and this allows for better airflow throughout the case. My build has been averaging 25-30C on idle with a max of 50C on high detailed games. Now, I have tried the acrylic panel and found that my temperatures, unsurprisingly, do go up: 30-45C on idle and 50-65C on load. It's not terrible temps but, while the acrylic does look cleaner, keep in mind that you're swapping temperatures for aesthetics.\n\nThe side tempered glass panel is another nice aspect of the H500. It's not clear like NZXT's line, but I would say it's around 40-50% tint, perhaps even 30%. It's definitely on the dark side. I didn't realise how tinted it would be, but it honestly looks amazing. Due to the 'heavier' tint, the cables inside are pretty much invisible and the RGB/lightning looks like its coming through the darkness. Honestly, it looks great and is definitely something I didn't know I wanted for my build.\n\nThe x2 200mm fan does deserve a mention as well, but this one's not as positive. It could be the lack of experience with RGB fans, but the cables were confusing as heck to pair with respective wires. I've didn't even spend as much time on the rest of the build combined compared to the fan wires themselves. I'm not going to lie when I say I cried a little out of frustration. The instructions aren't very helpful. If I remember correctly, the RGB cables were pinned into cables that were unnecessary towards the whole build. Figuring out that cable was not necessary took an amazingly stupid amount of time. After taking out the unnecessary cables and then figuring out the appropriate ones, it was smooth sailing after that. I'm not sure why it's become the new standard, but pictorial instructions are ridiculous. I can only imagine how difficult it would be for someone just starting out.\n\nCable management wise, there's really not much to say. It's superb and there's nothing difficult about it. You'll definitely need more zip ties than provided if you want a cleaner look. Also, the provided ties are surprisingly very thin so may snap easily if you stress it enough. There are notches on the cable side of the tower that allow you to zip tie cables on. Make sure to not zip tie in the panel grooves though. The rubberized routing holes and removable vertical bar is also appreciated.\n\nSome small thing that don't really detract but should be mentioned: if you're not going to fill the inside of this case, then be prepared to hear A LOT of air being pushed around. I have a lot of open space and it does sound cavernous. Also, this case is very much on the heavy side. It weighs a whopping 23.2lbs, maybe 30lbs+ after all the components are installed, compared to NZXT's 17.9lbs.\n\nIf you've stuck it out and read through my long speech, then in short I highly recommend this case. I've been very pleased with it and I'm glad I took a chance. Like a lot of people have been saying, don't go for any other H500 (for example, H500P or H500M). Just stick with the H500-NO SUFFIX. It is Cooler Master's best - as of right now - and pretty much offers everything required for a high end build. This is a great starter case, offering excellent airflow and enough space to experiment around with. You won't be disappointed."

        "review": "This case is well thought out with plenty of room behind the MB mount for cable management, but this comes at a price if you are mounting a larger CPU air cooling solution such as a Noctua NH-D15. The fan over the RAM slots causes the fan to sit high enough that it touches the glass of the case door. The case stays cool thanks to the two 200mm aRGB fans at the front of the case. That being said, one of the fans is not balanced correctly, so the LEDs look wonky and it adds to the noise level a bit. I would still purchase this case again despite the issues I mentioned."

Doesn't fit properly to the 3 pin slot. So what? do you use only 3 of the 4 pins on the 4 pin slot? Or do you use the ASUS\\MSI 3 pin cable (which will fit on the 3 pin d-led)?\n\nYep..\nUse the asus cable. Yes it works fine with gigabyte mobos- it's just a cable after all. Someone at COOLERMASTER needs to get the memo about this apparently, cause frustratingly enough- they have a faq for the 3 pin fans to the 4 pin connectors, but NOT the ARGB situation. I haven't seen it cleanly explained ANYWHERE, so there ya go. Even the manuals for gigabyte and the h500 were of little help on this confusion situation.\n\nI hope I just saved a lot of you 12+ hours of dizzying hair pulling stressful research.\nYou are welcome internet.\n\nSoo how is the case?\nWell it's the first pc I've built since 2014, so maybe everything has gotten really good in that time but I don't know. I just know it's incredible.\nThe cable management.\nThe space.\nThe cooling.\nThe housing for psu and ssd\\hdd.\nall of it is such a big win!\n\nIt's soo quiet my jaw hit the floor first time I fired it up.\nSeriously HOW IS IT THIS QUIET!?\nI paired it up with a noctua d 15 which is also impossibly quiet.\n\nIn low mode (which is when you are in windows not gaming) it's but a tiny whisper. When gaming it gets louder but still a big improvement from my old coolermaster case from eons ago.\n\nLIGHT SHOW!\nThe giant fans look downright industrial neon city. I am instantly addicted to 200mm fans and leds now. With how spacious this case is (this would have been called full tower at one time I bet lol) and how gorgeous the fans and lights are, with the glass side I am surprised how good it looks in person, and you better believe it looks great in a dark gamers room.\n\nSTURDY!\nWow is it heavy duty. The steel on this thing is thick. I don't think I'll have any issues with durability on this, at least not on the frame.\n\nFront Port panel-\nThis is one the reasons I chose this over other 200mm case fan models (like the monotech). I love how the front panel is slanted, and works great for my needs. Having the case on the floor it's perfect to see what i am plugging into. 4 usb ports is plenty for anything I want to do, and the microphone port is on the side I want and need (less cable stretching)\n\nBREATHE-\nVents vents vents, everywhere cept the back side panel (which is normal among cases). This case is soo big it has no problem breathing and keeping your stuff cool.\n\nCONS-\nThe only con I can find- is the 200mm fans are soo quiet, I can hear some tiny wobble in both of them. I don't think it's a defect, more like normal operating noise you simply would not hear with normal noisy fans.\n\nCONCLUSION-\nI never imagined spending 100$ on a case before, now I can't imagine spending less. The h500 argb is incredible, and it's fun to see how much case tech has advanced in the past 10 years. Even if you are like me (not an expert pc builder) it's neat how easy it's getting to make sweet looking towers that make all those console kids pretend they are not impressed). This is all just part of PC MASTER RACE PRIDE! And what a proud day it is to be a member of this fine race of superior gamers. Don't buy a cheapy 40$ case that can't breathe then stuff a 3080 in there! Esp if you don't have AC in the summer =D.\n\nThank you coolermaster- but please update your instructions (esp on your web site), cause they utterly failed to mention the asus cable can and SHOULD be used for some gigabyte mobos."

        "review": "I picked this up last week because I was tired of my old case which was dirty, dented, and dingy. I actually got this one \"used-excellent\" for $10 less and total cost was $100 (Canadian) after taxes. Why am I mentioning the price? Well...\n\nThe only reference I saw to the need for an SFX power supply was in a comment someone made - it's not (clearly) anywhere in the description or specs. So - when I took my old pc apart (which - with the exception of the case - had been fully upgraded in November) and started to put things in, I discovered that the ATX power supply I had was never going to fit. \"SFX required\" said that earlier-mentioned comment, so I went back to Amazon . ca and looked for one. Yeah, the cheapest one I could find was just over $200. Fine - it was a decent power supply, 80+ gold rated with a 7 year warranty, so i got it. I waited till the next day to continue the build and discovered much to my disappointment that the cpu liquid cooler i had for my previous PC was too big - and it was only a single fanned one - so off I trot to Amazon *again* to find a low-profile cpu fan. $76 and a day later, I have my CPU fan.\n\nIn case anyone's thinking \"this guy's an idiot - why would he expect his old pc components to fit in an mini-ITX case???\" - well, this idiot's previous set up was also a mini-ITX - it was just a different shape (more of a cube) so bigger things fit. Thankfully - my RTX 3060 fit just fine...except I can't put any fans underneath it on the bottom of the case, but that's fine, I have enough fans for now.\n\nHaving said all this, my verdict is that this is a really well built little case, very solid, there were enough screws and bits for whatever setup i needed, and while the instructions seemed a bit confusing at first, it was just because there were so many options for set up. This really is a beautiful case and I don't regret any of the required purchases - I just hate surprise expenses - but in the end, it was totally worth it.\n\nThe whole thing is now together, I have"

        "review": "Pros:\n- The white model looks extremely clean and minimalist.\n- All panels can be removed, along with most (all?) of the internal brackets. If you have difficulty building computers because of the lack of room to work, then this is the perfect case for you.\n- There is two locations for the SFX power supply, allowing you to use wider (244mm) and taller (up to 226mm) motherboard. However this feature is practically pointless (see below).\n\nThe problem:\n- Most mini-ITX motherboards cost at least the same price if not 25 to 50% higher than micro-ATX boards, you end up paying a lot more for less features (ex: 2 RAM slots instead of 4, only one M.2 instead of two, etc).\n- The selection of mini-ITX motherboards is also extremely limited compared to mATX.\n- While this case was specifically made for mini-ITX and three-slots-wide GPUs, this case should in theory also fit 3-slots micro-ATX motherboards. The problem is that 3-slots-tall micro-ATX motherboards are basically impossible to find depending on your CPU.\n- If only they made this case one slot taller, it would also have been compatible with mATX motherboards. IMHO it's already way too big to be classified as a small form factor case, so what's one more slot in height?\n\nTL;DR: if you're thinking about buying this case, make sure you complete your parts list and check that everything will fit. After over a week of futile research for 226mm or shorter mATX motherboards for LGA 1700, I'm regretting buying this case even though it is the most beautiful case I've ever owned."

        "review": " This NR200P is fairly easy to work with as majority of the panels are removable for easy access; I did not have any issues installing a CPU cooler while the motherboard was pre-installed and I did end up using an EVGA SFX power supply for this system. Majority of the work is tucking in all the necessary cabling for the power supply which is assisted by the velcro straps on the power supply bracket.\n\nI chose this case as it has a fairly small footprint and comes with a glass side panel that can be customized with a few vinyl decals; I appreciate that there is a pcie 3.0 riser cable for vertical GPU mounting and two black Cooler Master PWM fans included. I didn't end up using a lot of the accessories included with this case and I don't plan on swapping out the configuration too often; I am using M.2 storage drives exclusively as my ITX motherboard supports two NVMe SSDs and the case has a nice large cutout for easy access to the back of the motherboard.\n\nSince this case does not have a USB-C front panel port, you can definitely opt for more affordable mini ITX motherboard options that do not have an internal USB-C Gen 2 front panel connector. I did end up re-routing most of the front panel connection cables behind the metal front panel to keep things clean; It is a challenge to integrate RGB fans with a controller as you may need to sacrifice a 2.5 inch drive mounting point.\n\nTemperatures are good once you populate the top and bottom with 120mm fans; 31 degrees idle so far with an NH-L12s cooler and an RGB fan. Since there is an i5 10400f inside, this 65w CPU is thermally manageable in this case and I don't plan to do any overclocking. There is plenty of dust filtration to keep it clean inside.\n\nOverall, I feel there is a lot of excess case parts when finally completing the build process and I am not sure if can find a use for them. It's a beautiful case with the glass panel; You really need to do some research and see what restrictions there are for component sizing. It may be difficult to fit a custom cable extension kit as there is very little room to tuck excess cabling."

It's big enough to use large air coolers and large graphics cards, but it doesn't take over your whole desk. I especially like how you can take off the side panels and bottom when you are assembling your PC. It makes it so easy to access all the components and route your cables.

        "review": "This is an excellent case, and one of the few mainstream and affordable small form factor PC cases. Its major relative compromise is the size, which is close to as large as \"SFF\" gets. The case is also heavier than most SFF cases, being mostly made of steel, versus aluminum or plastic. However, it has nearly no size or cooling limitations in its class. Aesthetically, it follows the general SFF PC trend of minimalist design. Anything I have planned for my build, be it the largest GPU I can afford, or adding some old 3.5\" hard drives to my system, are possible in this case, which is easily transportable, though not quite backpack portable. I won't spend much time talking more about the positives of this case but I'll highlight some of my gripes, which should not be deal breakers, but ways that Cooler Master can improve the case without reducing its capabilities.\n\nThough the NR200 can accommodate almost any ITX hardware, its layout design is not completely perfect. I would have appreciated some gaps in the frame or motherboard area for routing cables behind the motherboard. One of my PSU cables is routed between the motherboard panel and the case's right side panel (when looking towards the case), but it's the flat kind which raises the case's side panel ever so slightly. Others with round or quality braided cables looking to route their cables behind the motherboard without raising the side case panel will need to route the cables in the gap between the motherboard and the motherboard panel. Unfortunately, they will need to do this before installing the motherboard, and uninstall the mobo every time before disconnecting. Some extra spaces or gaps that allow the cable connectors to slide through would have solved this problem. Another gap for the 24 pin connector would have improved quality of life a little, too, though I'm not sure if that would be possible in a practical spot. Having the thick 24 pin cable extending from the PSU in its default position can press down on the GPU without some careful cable management. Fortunately, Cooler Master provided some velcro straps underneath the PSU that help with this a lot, likely because they anticipated this problem for most consumers. Still, I can tell that Cooler Master intended this case to be as easy as possible for beginners, and neat cable management and avoiding pressure on the GPU will likely be a fairly difficult step of building in this case. Finally, the case could perhaps use some lengthier front I/O cables, so that they could have been routed behind the motherboard without blocking the PSU fan.\n\nSpeaking of front I/O, I would have also preferred a USB type C connector on the front. I can understand that it was not included due to cost, but I would prefer a version of the NR200 with a type C port and no fans, and likely would have even paid $10 more for that tradeoff. My version of the NR200 is the base version which comes with one 92mm fan and one 120mm fan, and the included fans are fine; not exceptionally quiet but not annoyingly loud. Still, I might replace both of them with Noctua fans to get the quietest possible airflow, and the 92mm fan will definitely not fit when I upgrade to the CPU cooler I plan on getting. Though Cooler Master included fans to appeal to customers who will use stock coolers and don't want to worry about aftermarket cooling solutions, they still have an opportunity to cater to more enthusiast consumers (who constitute a large part of the SFF community). Many SFF builders will either not need the included fans, or prefer to choose their own. They likely also prefer having near to mid-term future proof features. A version of this case without fans and a type C port, offered at a small premium, would still be a great deal.\n\nMy unit also came with a minor defect - the metal frame (not sure of the correct term) of one of the USB ports at the top is not completely connected. The end of the metal frame is bent inwards slightly as shown in the picture. I haven't encountered problems while plugging and unplugging USB devices, albeit carefully, into the jack multiple times over the past couple of weeks, so I didn't deduct a star or try to get it replaced. I'm optimistic that it'll stay as-is and not get bent worse over time. If this is a problem in manufacturing, hopefully Cooler Master can address this issue."

This was my first computer build, and my son, who has some experience, questioned my decision to go with the NR200P given the additional challenge of working in a small space--until he saw it in person. He was so impressed, he wanted one for himself.\n\nHere is my build:\n\nIntel Core i7-12700K\nASUS ROG Strix B660-I (mini-ITX)\nNvidia RTX 3070FE GPU\nKingston Fury Beast DDR5 16 x 2 RAM (rgb)\nEVGA Supernova 750W SFX power supply (note small form factor)\nSK Hynix Platinum P41 2 TB m.2 SSD\nSK Hynix Platinum P41 1 TB m.2 SSD\nThermalright Silver Soul 135 white cooler\nArctic P9 PWM PST 92mm fan\nArctic BioniX F120 fans x 2\nChassis fan hub CPU Cooling (the really cryptic looking one)\n\nNoteworthy: The Thermalright cooler DOES fit, even with the glass side. Actually has some room to spare.\n\nThe Kingston RAM has only about 2mm clearance from the cooling tower. But 2mm is enough.\n\nMy fan hub sits behind the front panel, nicely hidden, because it's not pretty. I routed several things behind that panel. You can also place SSDs there, but mine are both m.2, directly plugged into the MB, so that front panel was wide open for wires.\n\nI added two fans on the bottom and one at the back. Based on my review of the \"literature\" (YouTube), the best airflow with a cooling tower is to intake from the bottom and back, and exhaust thru the top. Including the fan in the center of my cooling tower, I have 6 fans in here and no problems with heat. The two stock fans are on top, and [update alert] a year later, they're still working flawlessly. I did add a magnetic filter on the back to block off the openings back there since I'm intaking air thru all those openings at the back. Technically, it's not held there by magnets. The tab from the case top holds it in place perfectly. My computer sits right next to an air filter which sits right next to a chinchilla cage, with hair and dust floating everywhere.\n______________________________________\n\nEveryone talks about the challenge of routing the cables in such a small case. For me, this was the fun part and I was very happy with the outcome. Like I said, I'm a first time builder, so I have no experience. Which means you can do it too. You can decide based on the pics whether you think I did a decent enough job.\n\nPut together a second NR200P system to surprise my dad. He didn't need a dedicated GPU, or rgb RAM, but otherwise the builds were pretty similar, and it went equally well. LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors, too! I would've gone with pink if it hadn't been $50 more at the time of my build. Still kinda wish I had, because pink is my color. But the white looks really nice too.\n\nTwo great experiences with this case! Highly recommended."

It's quite sturdy and heavy, with thick materials, all of the panels and bays can be removed for a comfortable building experience, all internal screws are interchangeable, and I think it has a highly appealing, refined but simple, industrial look. I absolutely don't regret switching to ITX, and I'm happy that I don't have any glass on this case. Previously I had an O11-mini clone with glass everywhere, and it made me fixate way too much on how does the inside look, leading to a lot of pointless expense.\n\nOf course keep in mind that you can't expect the exact same performance from these tiny ITX cases. I have a 3070Ti Founders Edition, which is not exactly energy efficient, nor does it produce a great airflow, and consequently it can start to throttle after a while on 100% performance, especially if the ambient temperature is high."

        "review": "I swapped all my parts from the pictured NZXT H210, and the build process was simple and stress free. I was starting to grow out of my old case, as I wanted something less obtrusive to take advantage of what ITX can really do. Since I didn't get custom cables, the stock PSU cables were quite rigid but luckily all the panels on the entire case are removable (and believe me, you're gonna have to remove them all). What really drew me to this case in particular is the price compared to the much more expensive FormD T1 and even the regular A4-SFX. But beyond that, I mainly liked how this case is simple without any obstructive lights or branding. This case is beautiful just by the fact that it doesn't draw attention to itself, which goes an extra step further since none of my components inside it have any RGB either.\n\nNow for the part that really blew me away was the temps. This shouldn't be surprising because the NZXT H210 is notorious for being an oven, but somehow I was expecting such a small case like this one to run hot as well. GPU temps dropped by more than 10 degrees across the board. Full load previously was 84C but has been reduced to 72C now. For my normal usage (60-75%) the GPU stays around 64C. Compared to the H210, the noise level is much quieter and the GPU is no longer screaming for its life. Another thing I like is how the GPU is on the right side of the case. Most other sandwich layouts I've seen have it on the left, but since I put my PC on the right of my desk this means the loudest part will be facing away from me.\n\nOverall, a great experience as a first time builder in a case this small. Lian Li has proven to be extremely high quality especially for this price point, and I like having the option to go liquid cooling later down the line next time I upgrade my PC again. I'm glad to be a member of the SFF PC community now with this case.\n\nEdit: Took off 1 star due to riser cable issues. Got a new GPU today, found out that it wouldn't work properly unless I set the PCIe setting to 3.0 despite the case saying it supports 4.0. Not that big of a deal since realistically it makes no difference while gaming, but it is a bit misleading in this scenario."

Not a big deal, but it won't be quite as clean looking as it should be.\n\n* Beware the CPU will likely run a bit hot since the top AIO is the only exhaust vent, and there isn't really room for any additional fans (with great effort I was able to squeeze a slim 80mm fan in the bottom but that was about it).\n\nMisc:\n\n* Requires a fair bit of disassembly to install AIO initially especially if you want to avoid remounting it with an existing motherboard.\n\n* My specs: ASrock Phantom ITX B550, Corsair h100 240mm AIO, NVidia RTX 3080 Ti, SF600 Platinum PSU."

Was a bit cautious pulling the front glass off.\nDelivery: The box was fully intact, that is always my biggest worry. Glass has no chips and is fitting well.\nIs it a fish tank? I think it has some small surprises, for instance the grommets are well-placed. Paint quality is more than sufficient. I put in a full ATX board and there is plenty of space to put in a liquid cooler with three fans. The assembly was a bit tricky here and there, it is because I do not have a modular power supply. I would definitely recommend this case, if you like to look inside the computer. There is plenty of airflow as the front plate sits about 5mm away from the case. Yup, glad I put this together.\nPro: Easy to assemble and build in\nCons: none so far.\n\nEdit: small update, I grabbed a bigger modular PSU and I just wish I could remove the disk cage without a drill (which I do not have).\nStill very pleased with the case, just need to learn cable management."

You could compensate and get larger ones but you risk bending the aluminum and breaking the glass front. The glass front is not removable either so you can only go in though one side. The way I had gotten around this was but using industrial hot glue. I just put some hot glue on each screw before threading it. What this does is dries and acts like self fighting washers. It does the job and I’ve had no worries."

        "review": "It was mentioned in the product description that fans were not included. I found out why after delivery.\nThere are 3 Fan openings facing the front but all are useless because all the predrilled holes are too large to use standard computer hardware. Worse yet the space in between the computer case and the nonremovable tempered glass is way too narrow. A butter knife with a paper towel wrapped around the tip barely fits. The case has other fan openings which are fine.\nTo overcome the obviously defective case design requires the following. Buy a black foam board ($2.00)available at most dollar stores. Measure and cut the foam board to tightly fit the front\nof the computer. Then carefully cut out of the board the openings for the 3 fans. I used super glue to attach the fans to the foam board. When installed, the board hides all the useless screw holes. The foam board is held in place from the inside with some tape. I will update this my review to include a picture of the fix."

        "review": "Case gets very warm very fast. aesthetics is great, really nice to look at. But, the back side leaves next to no room for cable management. everything is a tight fit. Fitting an Aio in this case isnt realistic as the Aio's ive tried dont fit properly in the top or the rear exhaust vent. 120mm aio and 240mm aio didn't fit good at all. nevermind a 140mm or 280mm..\n\n3/5 . Nice to look at, but next to no room for cable management in the back panel area. and if your Motherboard has a majority of its features and fan headers on the bottom, good luck.. the case is advertised as being able to have 3 fans on the bottom inside, which it wont if you have things plugged into the bottom of an Atx board. its advertised as supporting E-Atx.. I would NOT advise this and an Atx board is a tight enough fit and stand offs wont reach the end of an E-atx board, and half the standoffs dont even screw in. If your Motherboard has Shroud over the Vrm and heat pipes on the top, (example, x570 Meg Ace) you arent going to fit the 140mm advertised fan size at the top, and 120mm is a very tight fit. I have a 2070 super and a arctic air cooler, Duo series. the case is so tight the power cables of my Gpu are compressed against the glass and so is my Cpu cooler (bowing the glass), which is one of the more compact coolers, glass is cheap so risk of crack or break is very high. The Usb 3.0 cord is thick and large, being this tight it need a low profile cable!\n\nI love the look, which is why i purchased this case, looks really nice. But No cable managment room, high temps and the squeeze of fitting everything really takes this case down some pegs. I had to remove the usb 3.0 cable from the case just to fit the bottom fans.. I really hope to see an updated version of this case. its a tie for 2/5 or 3/5."

I am presently reviewing the b-Voguish case standalone; no fans/accessories or other parts along with it, and all I can say is I'd prefer if: the backcase had bigger/easier notches to hook onto to slide the plate back into place) The front glass was easier to detach for cleaning) More available slots to slide wires through the bottom plate and above the MB inside the case) Came with more wraps for cable management). Two complaints I have is the I/O panel at the top has ceased to recognize when or if my headset is plugged in after about a month, making it the issue where similarly you have to bend the phone charger cable a certain way for it to recognize it's in, and the mounting at the back is a little finicky to work with(Not a real problem, just personal opinion). Would definitely rate this a 5/5 if the I/O panel at the top still worked...!"

My full size ATX and ATX Extended MOBOs fit in this puppy with lots of room for my huge graphics card, dual fan water CPU water cooler and 4-RAM modules. With the power supply & drive bays hidden underneath the interior space, there's plenty of room to mod your PC without concerns for space. There are no drives to block airfolow and wiring is completely hidden below or behind the MOBO.\n.\nThe GLASS is thick and heavy, so bumping it won't break it. The side door can also be removed completely for full interior access for major mod work. With the front and side being mostly glass, you're allowed to show off your PCs guts and true coolness! The included RGB fans are huge 140mm's and push air in, beautifully. When everything is all lit up, the color takes over in a blackened room for cool FX.\n.\nThe underside, holds and hides your power supply and all interior drives, whether 3.5\" or SSD, there's room for them to live comfortably. The front fans cool the underside as well as the upper interior. With 3-fans in the front, you get lots of airflow. The top allows for 2-3 exhaust fans, and the back accepts a 120mm fan to blow hot air out the back as well. This is referred to as \"positive-negative\" flow balance. 3-in, 3-out. Well-designed for functionality and, well, just showing off!"

        "review": "So I don't like that it doesn't come with any fans. I was surprised when I opened it up and found none. I went back and read the entire Amazon listing and did find in the question section someone asked if it came with fans and the answer was NO, but the listing sure does not make that clear and makes it look like it does in the pictures. In retrospect, I think it probably makes more sense for them not too because you really need specialty fans to get the best cooling here, and if they'd added those, the price would have been significantly higher. I explain below.\n\nAs to the people saying their hardware gets hot, I suspect the main difference is what you are running and the type of fans you have. If you are running a brand new micro-atx motherboard/cpu and a big GPU, you aren't likely to see a big heat issue if you tune and face all your fans CORRECTLY. I would suggest however 3 - HIGH PRESSURE 140mm fans for the 3 front intake fans because the glass front obstructs direct airflow to them. High pressure fans will pull more air through the slits between the glass front and the case than a standard fan will. A standard fan will flow more air, but they can't pull or push air well against restrictions. The difference in the fan is just the blade width. The wider the fan blade, the higher the pressure the fan can transmit. I use Fractal High pressure fans.\n\nI specifically bought this case for its E-ATX capabilities. I am running a dual CPU server/workstation motherboard, and I can attest that this thing definitely heats up quickly with this setup. For this price point and case size, I can live with managing the heat situation, but its certainly not exceptional for a case. The biggest issue I have faced and its worth noting is that if you are running an E-ATX board, the TOP COOLING FANS WILL BE PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTED. This means you will need to purchase slim 15mm thick fans (120mm or 140mm) if you want to use the the top fan mounts. There are not very many choices here, and mostly they are not cheap.\n\nThe design is otherwise simple but elegant. I like the glass front and side panel with a hinge, and the isolated area under the board for the power supply. I also like that it fit my Supermicro E-ATX dual cpu server motherboard. There was only 1 standoff hole that wasn't used, and it was within 2 inches of another standoff anyway, so no stability issues with mounting or board flex. I don't think I've owned a case before that had no external drive bay slots before, not that you need those nowadays. I knew it had none when I bought it, it it really didn't hit me until I started looking at accessories to buy and was seeing external drive bay stuff I couldn't buy that I would otherwise have. No biggie though.\n\nIn all, just be aware of what you are buying this for, your budget, and its shortcomings and I don't think you will be dissatisfied if you keep your expectations reasonable. Just a word to the wise, if you weren't aware it does not come with fans, you might want to make sure you get all that figured out before you buy this case, because depending on what you are going to use it for, you may need a more custom configuration."

        "review": "This case is really amazing, but the one I recieved had some issues. The led's seems to be messed up and some of them are displaying the opposite color. It ws also missing the bottom fan filter. Building in it is a dream, as there is soo much free space in the back, and the psu in the back is so great. Yes it means a wider case but it also means less height, which creates much more visually pleasing dimensions overall. I'd probably go with the Dynamic White edition if I were to purchase again, as the rgb's included probably aren't worth the upcharge, especially when I got a case that legit can't display razer green, as green/red are the colors that are swapped. I can't think of any way to fix this, or where this swap would even be to start with.\n\nEdit- I managed to fix the rgb by cutting the ribbon wire near the end in half. The connectors were frayed, so I cut off that bit, and there was enough remaining to connect it still. It's way better looking now, and I'm surprised how much having the correct colors improves my appreciation for the RGB."

        "review": " This case is great. Read on for my experience.\n\nFirst, hardware specs:\n-Intel i7-11700k\n-MSI MPG Z590 Tomahawk Motherboard\n-Venroo U6Pro CPU fan\n-Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB DDR4 3000Mhz\n-EVGA RTX 2080ti\n-EVGA SuperNOVA 1000w Fully Modular\n-Samsung 970 EVO M.2 NVME 500GB\n-Samsung 860 EVO 1TB SATA SSD\n-9x Lian Li UNI AL fans\n\nPurpose:\nI bought this case as a replacement to a previous case which had terrible airflow. This case was recommended to me from a friend, and the positive YouTube reviews were compelling enough for me to make the purchase.\n\nArrival:\nThis case is a full-sized case, and it's big and heavy. I'm 5'4\"/115lbs and due to the nature of the size of the box, I struggled a bit to get the case out of the box - My arms are too short. The case was packaged well, and I had no concerns of lack of protection.\n\nUnboxing:\nInside the box, there was obviously the case. In addition, it came with a pretty terrible manual which didn't explain much. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see it came with a storage container with a variety of screws. While each screw type was individually packaged, it was nice to have an immediate storage container for mounting hardware. A nice welcome considering I don't have a \"work area\", and this was a kitchen table project.\n\nCase disassembly:\nI have a minor complaint with the case disassembly. You can't remove the side panel without removing the top of the case. I'm saying this is a minor complaint as it's not difficult to take apart the case. No tools are necessary, although I did use a screwdriver to loosen the screw which secures the swappable disk drive bays. Either my grip strength is awful, or they're incredibly tight. Whatever. Moving on! The top of the case is removed by a sliding button on the rear of the case. After the top is removed, the tempered glass panel and the metal side panel slide straight up. Easy peesy.\n\nInterior quality:\nOverall constructions and materials are great. I had no concerns about something cracking if I had torqued a fan screw too much. The top and side panels have magnetic dust filters, and there is a slide out dust filter for the bottom. There are two dogs in this house, and pet fur is always an issue. Relating to my minor complaint above, I wish I didn't have to take the top off to remove the side panel in order to clean the dust filters. At least, the bottom dust filter is ridiculously easy to remove and install.\n\nCable management:\nI saw there are some complaints in other reviews relating to cable management. I didn't have any issues. There is a ton of space on the back side of the case. And I even added extension cables to my power supply. A couple cable ties to coil up the excess resulted in a clean install both in the front and back. The power supply also installs in the back so it is not visible through the tempered glass panel.\n\nSwappable hard drive bays:\nThis case comes with four bays. I removed one of them as I didn't need it. Mounting the drives was easy, and there were no alignment issues with sliding the drives into the SATA ports. Each port has a SATA cable and power which need to be connected.\n\nFront panel:\nThe case has an RGB strip which is controlled with a button. Each time you press the button, you switch to a preset design/color. A cool feature, but I never change it because I honestly forget it exists. There are two USB ports on the top front and two on the bottom front so whether you keep your PC on the floor or on your desk, there's something for everyone. There are TWO USB 3.0 connectors, and my motherboard only has one USB 3.0 header so I am not using the front bottom USB ports. Check your motherboard to see if you have more than one USB 3.0 header on it. Otherwise, you'll be buying a PCIE USB 3.0 card. The USB-C port on the front is a nice touch as my previous case did not have this option, so I had to use the USB-C port on the motherboard which was inconvenient. First world problems, I tell you.\n\nOne minor challenge:\nThis isn't really a problem with the case, however it's more of a problem relating to Lian Li's thought regarding its other case accessories. Due to the size of my CPU cooler, I'm unable to utilize the PCIE x16 slot on my motherboard. I debating on purchasing the vertical mounting bracket from Lian Li, but according to their reviews, it only leaves a couple of millimeters of space between the GPU and the tempered glass panel. If they're going to offer a vertical mount, perhaps they should build the cases a bit wider - although this case is already pretty large. I don't know. If it's already this big, what's another inch and a half in width? But this isn't really a problem with the case but more of a problem relating to a combination of my choice of CPU cooler as well as motherboard since I probably should get one with more x16 slots. Obviously, I did not reduce my rating because of it.\n\nCPU Temperatures:\nOf course, mileage may vary as it depends on your hardware, fans, cable management, etc. Keep in mind the i7-11700k is notorious for running extremely hot. In this case, temperatures have been fantastic. I haven't seen anything above 74C degrees during a 15-minute CPU stress test. At idle, temperatures sit around 30C degrees.\n\nGPU Temperatures:\nSame disclaimer as above as you may get different results, but during gaming at 1440p/105fps, I haven't seen GPU temperatures over 65C. At idle, temperatures sit around 45C degrees.\n\nSummary:\nBuy the case. You'll like it. If it has a genie which can grant wishes, I have yet to discover its ability. But considering the great job Lian Li has done with the case, I wouldn't be surprised."

Initially, I went with the Fractal Meshify-C White case. It was a good case, but it had some drawbacks that made me realize that since I'm building a quality gaming PC, why settle?\n\nSeveral things made me decide to shop for a better case: The space behind the motherboard wasn't enough for all the cables and controller for the fans, and I was tired of having to physically mash the left panel down to get it to close. The front PCB was built into the front panel, so any time I wanted to open it up, I had to be careful not to put too much stress on the connecting cables going to the motherboard; and finally, in order to have 3 intake fans on the front of that case, you had to remove the panel on the shroud, which left an ugly, gaping hole exposing all the cables that you want to hide. Initially, I modified the panel and used my angle grinder to make a cut out to allow room for the 3rd fan, but the cut was very uneven and I had to use some car weather stripping I had laying around to hide the jagged edges. So I began to shop for a better option.\n\nEnter the Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL. I'd never bought a case this expensive before, so I read and watched every review of it I could find. I was tired of the compromises that companies made in the $75-$100 price range, and the O11 XL seemed to be what I was looking for, so I pulled the trigger.\n\nPackage arrived on time, no visible damage. The case itself was in perfect shape, no dents or scratches on the glass panels.\n\nFirst impression: This case is freakin' SWEET! Finally, I have a case that checks all the boxes for me, and looks amazing! I love the glass front and side and the brushed aluminum finish on the front. Everything about this case has a very high quality feel to it. All the panels fit together perfectly, no annoying gaps.\n\nThe LED strip looks great, too, very bright and colorful with smooth transitions on the RGB patterns. I like that it has the M/C buttons on the front to change modes and colors. Switching to the 8th mode (LEDs will be off) syncs it to my MB via Gigabyte's RGB Fusion software.\n\nThis case is large, which I love. There's so much room to work with, and I have plenty of options for future upgrades and additions.\n\nI really like the hot swap bays. I took one out for cable management and used the other one for my 2 TB SSHD.\n\nThis case has TONS of options. There's so many mount points for drives and SSDs, it's ridiculous.\n\nI'm running an air cooled build, and this case is great for that. Some reviewers recommend the original O11 Dynamic for air cooled builds, but the clearance for tower CPU coolers is a bit low on that one. I had originally ordered that one and then I checked the clearance specs from Lian Li's website and realized that my Pccooler GI-D66A was too big. The XL is perfect for that cooler, it fits with a few mm's to spare. Also, I wanted a 120mm rear exhaust fan and the XL is the only model that has a place for it.\n\nThe craftsmanship of the case is straight up on point. I'm really impressed. You really do get what you pay for, and I am glad that I spend the extra $ to get a case worthy of my build.\n\nBuilding in the O11 XL was a good experience. The size of the case allowed for ease of assembly and nothing was too cramped. For example, on the Meshify-C I had to use needle nosed pliers to get the CPU power cable inserted into the MB, since there was no room to get my hand in between the plug and top of the case. With the O11 XL, I had more than enough room to get my hand in there.\n\nWith all the fans, controllers, etc. I have TONS of cables. Cable management in this case is great, the layout is perfect for hiding all the wires behind the MB. I like the cable shroud panel in the back as well, it helps hide the insanity lol. The openings in the front are well-placed with nice rubber grommets, allowing me to have the cleanest looking build yet.\n\nThe versatility of this case is a big plus. I was able to move the PSU up to the middle, remove one of the hot swap trays, and use the top one for my hard drive, thus allowing space at the bottom for the fan controllers and PWM hubs.\n\nPlacing and mounting all 10 of my fans was easy, I really like that the SSD trays are removable, with one more plate to hide the gap when using 3 120mm fans on the side. I also love the 3 fan tray on the bottom, it made mounting those 3 intake fans a breeze. Currently I have the 3 side and bottom fans as intake and the 3 top and 1 rear as exhaust for a slightly positive pressure air flow setup. I am slowly migrating to all Corsair QL fans, as the white really matches up well with the case color, and these fans have rear LED rings as well, so whether I mount them as intake or exhaust, there's no compromise in LED visibility.\n\nSo what about temps? Same as the Meshify. CPU temps at idle in 30's, full load in 60's. GPU junction temps when playing graphics intensive games like GOW5 is 70s-80s. Nice.\n\nI LOVE THE GPU BRACKET! My sapphire pulse GPU is pretty long and it has a bit of a sag. In the Meshify, I used a GPU stand, but I realized that I couldn't use a stand on the O11 XL, since the bottom fans would be in the way. Lian Li thought of everything though, and included a GPU bracket that can support up to 2 GPUs. As I was building, I noticed the instructions recommended putting the bracket hardware on the 2 MB mounting screws just to the left of the right edge. However, the heatsink of my MB PCH was too thick. No problem, I just installed the bracket on the two outermost mount points, and it just cleared my SSD ports and works great! GPU is nice and level.\n\nThis case is so well built that DB levels with all 10 fans running is quite low, and air flow is more than sufficient for proper temps both at idle and under full load stress tests. Pretty much no difference from the open front design of the Meshify C.\n\nAll in all, am I glad I got this case? HELL YES I AM. It looks great, performs great, and has all the room and options I need for both now and in the future.\n\nI definitely recommend it!"

The last thing I did was remove the protective plastic from the glass panels and I immediately noticed multiple small chips in the large glass side panel. I contacted Amazon but was told to contact Lian Li because Amazon could not replace individual parts and I did not want to disassemble my entire PC to return the case. Lian Li is now refusing to replace the glass panel because they \"can't see the damage.\" I will change my review if the situation is resolved, but it appears this company is not willing to stand behind their products.\n\nUpdate: After days of back and forth and sending additional photos, Lian Li still claims they cannot see the issue but is finally willing to replace the damaged glass panel. Updating review to 4 stars. So far the case is great but it's disappointing that it takes a week of arguing to get a damaged part replaced."

        "review": "I got this \"compact\" ATX case and these guys make seriously high quality stuff with an eye for detail. The case is about 1.5x the width of your standard ATX case, making it closer to a large box than a typical tower.\n\nThe extra width facilitates a machined aluminum mobo partition with PSU bracket on the backside to hide it and any 3.5\" HDDs as well as any cables you don't want showing. The only thing I'm iffy on is the bottom mounted SSD 2.5\" drive mounts, but even with those in use* you can install a vertical GPU riser if you want. It can hold two 360mm (three fan) radiators with room to spare. You can of course use any size radiator + fan combo in any of the three mount positions, but it appears max capacity is two 360mm rads and another 240mm radiator up top (three radiators total)**. Oh and it can house your RGB and/or fan controllers in a special mount slot, with lots of covert places to do custom mounting with velcro if necessary.\n\nThis beautiful case is also meant to mount small to large water tanks/reservoirs in several places, even next to the vertical GPU on the base panel (or so it looks). I always thought a pair of small but strong magnets on the bottom of the tank and on the outside bottom of the case would work in any mid-large ATX case and not effect any components or magnetic disc drives so long as they are a reasonable distance away like they would be here, but that would be dangerous and only attempted if you are a pro and know the risks of magnets and PCs.\n\nLast but not least, the case RGB works with Razer Chroma software so no need for any third-party utilities from Lian Li. If you use MSI/Mystic Light compatible boards, the latest version of that now works with Chroma Studio. Of course you can use any mainboard and/or third-party software and tools you want, but since you use Chroma, may as well run it all through one app. All my fans, RGB, peripherals, controllers, everything, all controlled with Chroma and one software interface. Can't overstate how nice it is to not have to screw with several control interfaces or BIOS tools or remotes.\n\nThis case is built incredibly well, uses real tempered glass, and has sturdy metal and aluminum components. It has a very aethetically pleasing exterior with a clean, custom look and feel and is purpose made to show off a liquid cooling setup or other internal modding. I'll try to post pics of my Troll Green build once I decide on hard or soft tubing. This case will live through many hardware upgrade and is a modder's dream to build in.\n\n*it looks like you may lose one SSD mount slot if your vert-GPU bracket is very large or has odd dimensions.\n**the manual lists three rads as possible, but I'm using just one 240mm and one 360mm with fans in the remaining slots to move air up and down the case.﻿"

The glass panels were sealed and was even sent extra screws and parts just in case anything was broke. It is a very beautiful case and it’s also uniquely build. There is another 011 Lian li case but this one is the part 2 of the series they call this one the deluxe edition. They also just released a mini version of this case that is completely all white as well. Check it out if you need something smaller and which looks alike, that one was made for an all white build purpose like this one as well but some Of my build has black accents on but it’s not a big deal. Now back to my review. I Installed everything neatly in this system because the side plates have a compartment where you put all your cable management and hard drives. I left it a mess in the back lol because In the beginning I had so many Installations to do. So I had to wire everything first lol. But overall I made it look neat after everything was working. I have nothing but happiness when I finished this build. I wasn’t able to put an RTX card but I installed a 1080 TI for regular gaming and some streaming task. And ladies and gents let me tell you the temperature stays at 50 idle and the cpu stays around the 30-40 degree temperature. I used a Corsair radiator with double fans. I also used some cool master fans around my build and let me tell you wow, beautiful rgb. Once I turned this bad boy on. This tower makes any build look spectacular and ready to show off and display. But this Lian Li 011 deluxe tower is not space hungry. if you need space for hard drives and wires this thing is truly your friend when it comes to compatibility and storage. I definitely recommend it. Don’t lose out."

The Charger rated 5v 3000mAh with switch on it also included in the box, it is enough to power for pi4. The kit also included 4pcs of the blue heatsink: bigger one for CPU, medium for wifi and the other small heatsinks are for the ethernet onboard. A bonus also includes a screwdriver so it can assemble the case. So far I really like this case kit because the quality is really good for the price and also includes additional accessories that I can use to maintain my Pi4. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who needs to cool down their pi4 and need a case."

This case is a good option if you don't need to regularly plug and unplug wires or cable to the GPIO pins, because that would mean unscrewing the top every time, or just leaving the top open or unscrewed. If you need to plug wires or cable to the GPIO pins and leave them plugged in, that will be fine, as they will fit through the gap underneath the screwed-in top. I have several Raspberry Pi 4's, and I bought one of these cases initially, then after evaluating it, I bought three more. I like it."

The grey bottom piece on one side is slid in, the other side uses long silver screws to screw into the copper nut inside the case in the black colored middle part of the case shared with the top 4 screws. The maker could open and close the case infinite times without damaging the case and the case could be long lasting.\n\nThe middle black part has ventilation holes, the top piece and the middle piece has a gap in between to allow the camera, monitor and GPIO pin cables to stick out without problem.\n\nThe top cover and fan placement comparing to other pi cases is more in the center and higher, this is why it is designed for POE hat. When using a low profile POE hat, with extra height of space the fan is able to blow air into the gap between the hat and the modules like CPU, RAM, USB, NIC to cool them down; heat will not trap in between. Then blow out from the ventilation holes above the sd card slot.\n\nTest:\nStock settings with Raspberry Pi OS\n\nRoom temp: 29c\nBare board 10 min idle temp: 58c\nBare board 10 min video stream temp: 75c\n\nReset to room temp wait for 30 min\nFan speed 3v3.\n10 min idle temp: 42c\n10 min video stream temp: 50c\nCool down in seconds after stream: 45c\n10 min idle from stream: 42c\n\nPro:\nIn the test the cooling temperature shown with 16 degrees differences in idle and 25 degrees in video stream load. The fan produces close to 0 noise under 3v3.\n\nPower supply with on/off switch, a case which could access GPIO, camera and display with POE hat without compromising much of the cooling efficiency.\n\nCase is a bit flexible so when a cable is going between the top cap and the case, it will be elastic to let it pass without much pressure.\n\nCase is higher compares to most other cases, gives more room to work with.\n\nCost yet effective.\n\nCon:\nCase could use a better color tone, like red, blue, yellow, orange for the middle part and the bottom could use black instead.\n\nThe supplied screw driver is useful but not magnetized.\n\nNo grill protection for the fan hole.\n\nOverAll:\nThe Miuzei Raspberry Pi 4 POE Hat Case Kit is a well thought out designed piece with probably the cheapest(in price) material and achieved the highest result in terms of cooling and protection for a POE hat setup. Wish they would offer the kit bundled with an HDMI adapter or cable. Personally I would prefer this case over most other cases out there due to better cooling and more space for options to wiggle around."

        "review": "This thing is huge. Offers a ridiculous amount of space for any setup. You can see in my pictures the difference in size between a standard tower and this absolute unit. I needed to a fit a 4080 and this does it nicely. If you have a 360mm liquid cooler, it will ONLY fit on one side of the case (right). 240mm (pictured) has many more options but I fit it to the top.\n\nSome things to note, PCI connected cards are vertical as opposed to the standard horizontal position. I find this to be an advantage since the 4080 is so long, the stress is on the metal bracket rather than all along the length of the card. I still have a sag bracket but you may need more than the standard height if you elect to remove one of the bottom panels. It does take some getting used to since the top of the box gets cluttered with wires but is hidden when all buttoned up.\n\nAlmost every piece is removable. The large glass panels, the vented grills on the bottom, the top grate, its basically a giant lego piece. The frame flexes more than I'd like when the large panels aren't installed and the box is being moved. With the motherboard and other devices screwed down, it makes me extremely undercomfortable at the flex that will be transferred to the devices when moved without the panels.\n\nI turned every fan to intake except on top where the hot air will exhaust. So far, works like charm with custom cardboard shroud and fans that exhaust the hot air outside in warmer weather. During the winter, the PC doubles as a space heater..."

I ended up fixing this buy putting it a piece of vinyl wrap on the glass plenty of airflow in the system even with a 360 rad. one of the better cases out there and with up to 11 fan mounts."

        "review": "I love my new mini fridge. The easily removable glass panes and the spring release top panel are very convenient for making quick changes and cleaning. The case itself has a lot of room for fans, I figure two fans on the bottom front grill, 3 fans on either side of the case with the provided radiator mount, and 2 fans at the top of the case. If you’re creative you’ll get another radiator mount and put 3 more fans on the other side of the case for 10 total fans. Also, the back of this thing has enough room for about 135 hdds /ssds really can’t go wrong."

I was trying to get the 900 version(even the 500 version is way big), but is to big for my desk or even my homelab. Its a great modular case, you can actually play around with a lot of configuration, but if you are going the \"low budget way), this is not a great choice. The only way you can actually utilize this in full or effectively , will be to use full spec hardware.

The overall design of this case is good. There is plenty of space for everything. Unfortunately, the best setup for fans in this case calls for negative pressure within the case. This typically leads to dust coming into the case vs positive pressure. For their sake, Thermaltake has put meshes absolutely everywhere which is good but i still expect dust particles to get inside the case due to the negative pressure setup with an AIO 360 cooler. The plugs for the case are at the top and covered by a mesh. This is not a big deal if the case wasn't soo big. If you are putting the case under a table, trying to get to the plugs for usb, monitor, ect, is quite difficult."

The zipper is a dual model, so you can open/close from either direction.\n\nThe interior is lined with supple material to protect your device and items that you are storing. You can carry several SD cards, charger and other attachments that you may have for your Steam Deck. The deck fits nice and snug due to the molded casing inside.\n\nIt's a very nice case, doesn't cost all that much and is a valuable investment for your Steam Deck!"

        "review": "Most of this case feels like the stock Deck case. It is slightly thicker, under 1 inch.\n\nThe added space is used as a storage cubby in the middle of the base of the case, under where the Steam Deck fits. One thing I noticed is that the pocket actually is quite large and is a very obvious area to put accessories, charger, and even the dock in. It fits all those as well.\n\nThe interior is also very similar, its a soft fabric, with enough padding. The screen cover is soft and seems to work as intended.\n\nOverall, I am happy with this storage case, personally I find that it is less of a travel case (I use a kickstand case with hard front cover, PD charger and USB-C cables) but more of a general storage and travel case when you NEED to bring everything (USB-C dock, charger, cables)."

Sie ist jedoch etwas dicker, jedoch nicht mehr als 2,5 cm.\n\nDie zusätzliche Fläche wird als Stauraum in der Mitte des Taschenbodens genutzt, unter dem Platz für das Steam Deck. Es ist aufgefallen, dass das Staufach sehr geräumig ist und ein offensichtlicher Ort für Zubehör, das Ladegerät und sogar das Dock ist. Alle diese Dinge passen problemlos hinein.\n\nDas Innere der Tasche ist ebenfalls sehr ähnlich, mit einem weichen Stoff und ausreichender Polsterung. Der Bildschirmschutz ist weich und scheint seine Funktion zu erfüllen.\n\nZusammenfassend bin ich mit dieser Aufbewahrungstasche zufrieden. Persönlich empfinde ich sie eher als Aufbewahrungstasche als Reisetasche (ich verwende eine Ständerhülle mit harter Frontabdeckung, PD-Ladegerät und USB-C-Kabeln), aber sie eignet sich gut als allgemeine Aufbewahrungs- und Reisetasche, wenn man alles (USB-C-Dock, Ladegerät und Kabel) mitnehmen möchte."

Ab Werk passt es nur für das Steam Deck. Da der die Hartschalen-Hülle aber sehr stabil ist wäre es potentiell auch für andere Decks denkbar. Man müsste nur das innere heraustrennen und dann mit Schaumstoff auskleiden, dann halt die entsprechende Form herausschneiden. Gut, das dürfte etwas Arbeit sein, aber nur so eine Idee\n\n- derzeit keine negativen Punkte ersichtlich\n\nFazit: Das Case ist gut verarbeitet und bietet guten Schutz für den Transport. 5 Sterne"

        "review": "Das Case macht auf den ersten Blick eigentlich einen guten Eindruck. Es erinnert an das originale Case nur mit ein bisschen mehr Platz und dafür schlechterer Qualität.\n\nDas Case ist leider etwas unförmig. Ich bin mir nicht sicher woher diese Unförmigkeit kommt, aber was kommt mir so vor als wäre der Reißverschluss leicht schräg, wodurch Boden- und Deckenteil leicht versetzt sind, wenn man die Tasche schließt.\n\nIn der Tasche sind verschiedene Laschen eingenäht die über oder unter dem Steam Deck platziert werden sollen. Diese Laschen sollten alle mittig eingenäht sein, sind aber leicht versetzt.\n- Die Lasche die das untere Fach vom Steam Deck trennt ist einigermaßen gut platziert; keine Einwände hier.\n- Die beiden Bänder mit Klettverschluss, die das Steam Deck in Position halten sollen, sind beide in unterschiedliche Richtungen versetzt, wodurch das Band schräg über der dem Steam Deck liegt; das ist ein rein ästhetisches Problem und damit durchaus zu verkraften.\n- Die Lasche, die über dem Steam Deck platziert wird ist hier das größte Problem. Sie ist in meinem Fall ca. einen halben cm nach rechts versetzt, was dazu führt, dass sie den rechten Analogstick leicht zur Seite drückt. Ich möchte allerdings nicht, dass der Analogstick kontinuierlich belastet wird, während sich das Steam Deck in der Tasche befindet, weshalb ich die Tasche vermutlich nicht verwenden werde.\n\nEin weiterer Negativpunkt ist das Fassungsvermögen. Laut Produktbeschreibung finden hier Netzteil, Dock und Kopfhörer gleichzeitig Platz, was leider nicht der Fall ist. Das originale Netzteil passt, je nach Model bekommt man ggf. auch noch Kopfhörer unter, aber ein Dock passt nie im Leben mit in die Hülle, insbesondere nicht wenn man sein Netzteil mitführt. Hier handelt es sich einfach nur um irreführende Produktangaben.\n\nLeider kann ich das Case niemandem empfehlen. Das originale Case, das ja beim Steam Deck mitgeliefert wird, ist sehr viel hochwertiger und liefert lediglich ein bisschen weniger Stauraum. Ich bleibe jedenfalls beim originalen Case."

        "review": "As my first build, I think it is a high quality case. It came with 2 ARGB fans, that were quite complicated to setup, my motherboard did not have an ARGB header so I had to use the reset switch with the controller, leading to less customization of the fans, but still good looking fans overall with about 10 presets bound to the reset button when you use the controller. The cable management room was good, although there could be a bit more room at the back of the case. There were many routing spots that were all good, although I would like one at the front of the case above the power supply for the graphics card. The airflow is very good, although once I get the money I am likely going to buy a 3 pack of fans, for the top and back. The PCIE cover brackets are very hard to manipulate and you cannot put them back, so when I made the mistake of taking out the first one instead of just second and third slots for the graphics card it led to an open hole into the case. It doesn't come with dust filters on the top. It is a fantastic looking case only with these very minor drawbacks. I would give it a solid 8/10."

        "review": "Hello!\n\nThis is a great case, I believe. But, I do have some problems with it. Concerning the materials, concerns with airflow, and a problem with the particular purchase that I made.\n\nI want to first say that the layout is pretty alright. It has great I/O, and it looks great. Cable management is made easier with areas for zipties, which the case provides you with. I personally got the acrylic version, and I believe that was the wrong move. If anyone buys this case, I recommend the mesh version, not the acrylic. However, it looks great nonetheless. It comes with a mesh filter for the top, if for some reason you decide to suck air through the top of the case, which probably isn't the best choice. The preinstalled fans run silent, which is great however I can't tell if the airflow I feel is due to low RPM, or the fact that the fans are too close fo a solid surface than I would appreciate.\n\nNow for the issues I have with the case. The acrylic version specifically for my first point. You see, Cooler Master decided to place the fans rather close to the front acrylic. Which wouldn't be a problem if it was mesh and not acrylic. I personally think there was much less ventilation being used than was available, I guess this was an attempted placebo affect. Next up, I personally dislike the acrylic, because it's acrylic. It's very easy to scratch, which results in it looking bad. Something I admittedly should've thought about before purchasing it. With the combination of reasons, I beg you to get the mesh version and not the acrylic.\n\nLastly, this is a personal thing that is very likely to be an isolated issue. The two front fans arrived dead. I didn't knock a star off for this reason, but it is something that should be kept in mind. If this is a known issue, make sure you have a spare fan for diagnosis. To determine if it really is the fans on the case, or if you need to look at your motherboard.\n\nIn the end, I think this is a decent case. And if you are looking at this case, I recommend you look at the mesh version instead of the acrylic. It's a great step up from Cooler Master's MasterBox QL300, but only if you go mesh."

        "review": "Up front, I'd like to say this is a great case...with some issues. None of these issues would stop me from purchasing again, but hopefully I can help prepare you before you buy this (Which you should).\n\nFirst thing you should know is that the build and quality for the price are on par. I spent months researching and hunting deals that led me to this one. Sturdy frame, decent preinstalled rgb fans, mesh filters, adjustable harddrive case, tempered glass, air flow channels on the front panel and plenty of room for expansion even in a MATX case.\n\nNow for the issues: you'll definitely be tight on room when dealing with cable management. The rear panel compartment is tight, no biggie, but you'll need to be on your \"A\" cable management game. And the preset cable management job you start off with doesnt exactly help. #2 is the instruction manual. Very vague especially with connecting the RGB fans. The rgb configuration can throw off a 1st time builder like myself but I'm sure you'll be able to resource for the right answer. #3 I get that this case is made for multiple MoBo sizes, but this case is advertised as a MATX box, yet the openings to feed your cables through do not match up easily to an MATX Motherboard. #4 I learned how to build PCs watching youtube videos and they typically build in a specific order. MAKE SURE TO START WITH THE CASE MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS FIRST. There are some things like removing expansion slots that will drive you mad if you've already installed your MoBo. Once you complete the \"prep\" stuff from the manual, you can follow along with most youtube builds with ease. I learned the hard way.\n\nOverall this case is great, and obviously you'll have to play the tech lottery with DOA parts, but if you get a functional system you'll be happy!"

Through my nervous reopening and upgrading parts (yeah, I still get nervous opening up my built system), it's still running fine.\n\nI recommend"

        "review": "So ive read some reviews and alot of people mention the lack of airflow, I personally havent ran into this problem myself, though when I first got it both fans that came stock worked but only one's RGB was working so I contacted Coolermaster nd they sent me a new fan. Also had another 120mm fan from a older tower that I added to the top so 3 in takes (1 top, 2 front) and one exhaust (back) and my temps range between 35°-60° for my CPU and between 35°-70° for my GPU. My specs are,\n-Ryzen 5 2600\n-EVGA GTX 1070 SC\n-Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x 8GB 3200mhz RAM\n-Auros B450 M mobo\n\nOnly other possible downside is if you were looking to SLI gpu's this case wont allow it but that could be a combination w/ my MOBO too. Other then that I love this case, its sexy, sturdy and does everything I want it to do! The front panel is pretty basic (Mic/head phone jack, reset, power and 2 usb ports) but w/ it combined w/ my MOBO's IO in the back its perfect for me! Would totally recommend this to a first time builder or another gamer looking to upgrade or change their case w/ a budget/medium/lower high end gaming build!"

        "review": "First of all it's a big case. But don't think that means it can take a full size atx motherboard it can't. Your gonna be buying a micro atx and it barely fits. The main attraction to this is the led lighting system you can plug it and have pretty lights. Not something I am into personally but there you go. The power supply is on bottom. As are the bays for the hard drive. You are meant to put screws into your SSD and place them in case holes. No they won't stay and will soon be flopping about. Finally expect it to weigh a ton. I'm not a small guy and horsing this around is a workout. The layout is just wrong it challenges every time you could do without another challenge and finally - no cdrom place which may be standard these days but a disappointment to me."

Die Lüfter- bzw Radiatoren-Einbauplätze vorne, im Deckel und an der linken Seite, lassen sich alle durch das Lösen weniger Schrauben komplett entnehmen, so dass man die Radiatoren und Lüfter bequem außerhalb des Gehäuses montieren kann und diese dann nach Montage wieder ins Gehäuse einsetzen kann. Die Verarbeitung des Gehäuses ist einwandfrei und massiv, welches sich auch im Gewicht niederschlägt, das schon ohne Komponenten 18,7 kg beträgt. Das Kabelmanagement ist praxisgerecht gelöst und sorgt mit genug Fixierungs Möglichkeiten für eine saubere Kabelführung.\n\nMich hat die Verarbeitung, die durchdachte Flexibilität, das Raumangebot und die Qualität dieses Gehäuses überzeugt, so dass ich es wieder kaufen würde"

According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).\n\nCompared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):\n- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings\n- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads\n- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirector\n\nNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).\n\nIf you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium. If you also don’t plan to overclock, consider the i7-13700F."

        "review": "Processore AMD Ryzen 7 5800X (8C/16T, 36MB di cache, fino a 4,7 GHz max Boost)\n\n📋 ⭐Descrizione del Prodotto⭐ :\nSò che chi compra questo tipo di processore sa esattamente di\ncosa si tratta,tuttavia anche chi si approccia le prime volte\nal cambio di un pc,attraverso le recensioni può farsi un idea\npiù chiara leggendo i pareri di chi l'ha comprato,mentre per i\ndati puramente tecnici ci sono sempre le recensioni dei siti di\nhardware con un infinità di test per tutte le esigenze.\nin tutti i casi questo è un processore con otto core fisici e\nsedici thread con una frequesza di base pari a 3,8 Ghz,con\nun processo produttivo a 7nm e un boost clock che arriva fino\na 4,7 Ghz con un TDP di 105W e una temperatura di esercizio\ndefinita sicura da AMD fino a 90°,dispone anche della tecnologia\nPCI Express (PCIe) 4.0 e compatibilità con ram DDR4 fino a 3600Mhz\n\n👩‍🎓Terminologia:\n📌CORE FISICI\nCon il termine core in informatica si intende tipicamente\nil \"nucleo elaborativo\" di un microprocessore.\n📌THREAD\nUn thread in informatica,è una suddivisione di un processo in\ndue o più filoni(istanze)o sottoprocessi che vengono eseguiti\nconcorrentemente da un sistema di elaborazione a singlecore o\nin multicore.\n📌FREQUENZA BASE\nE' la frequenza operativa minima alla quale lavora il processore\nanche senza eseguire nessuna istanza/calcolo.\n📌BOOST CLOCK\nE' la frequenza operativa massima che un processore può raggiungere\na seconda dei processi che sta elaborando,questo boost clock è\nraggiungibile in modo completamente automatico da un CORE alla volta\nin modo alternato salvo modificare manualmente le opzioni del bios\ndella scheda madre e che da la possibilità di innalzare con le dovute\ncautele la frequenza su tutti e otto i core simultaneamente;\nquest'ultima operazione è comunemente chiamata \"overclock manuale\".\n📌TDP\nIl TDP è un'indicazione del calore (energia) dissipato da un processore\nquando lavora a pieno carico(si misura in Watt).Si tratta del calore che\nil sistema di raffreddamento dovrà smaltire per mantenere la temperatura\ndel processore entro una soglia limite.\n📌Processo produttivo espresso in nanometri (nm)\nè un processo produttivo della tecnologia dei semiconduttori,con cui\nverranno prodotti i circuiti integrati a larghissima scala di integrazione(VLSI).\nLa fonderia TSMC ha realizzato in volumi i primi chip a 7nm nel corso del 2018\ned è attualmente il principale fornitore di processori con tale tecnologia.\n\nCome si comporta il ryzen 7 5800x nei confronti della concorrenza?\nil metro di misura con cui equiparare il 5800x di AMD per fascia di\nprezzo e caratteristiche è l'INTEL i7 di 10°generazione 10700k e\nquello di 11°generazione 11700k,potremmo considerare anche altri\nprocessori di Intel aventi più core in quanto AMD ha fatto con il\nRyzen 7 5800x un lavoro così egregio in termini di performance che\npotrebbe andare ad infastidire in determinati contesti anche processori\nsulla carta più potenti e performanti,ma non è questa la sede per fare\nparagoni a suon di dati,se volete approfondire ci sono una moltitudine\ndi comparazioni online,tuttavia almeno nei primi due esempi citati il 5800X\nsi assesta in prima posizione con un incremento di prestazioni su vari scenari\ndi utilizzo nell'ordine del 5/10% minimo fino ad un massimo del 20/25%.\nQuesti scenari includono indistintamente una media generale sia di giochi\nche programmi professionali.\nLa piattaforma(scheda madre e chipset)di riferimento da me scelta per il mio\nnuovo pc con R7 5800x è stata la Gigabyte aorus elite con chipset x570,\nvolendo avrei potuto ripiegare su una piattaforma con chipset x550 e non avrei\ncomunque perso ne la compatibilità con R7 serie 5000 ed un eventuale upgrade\na R9 serie 5000 ne avrei rinunciato al PCIe 4.0 ma ho preferito la x570 per una\nmoltitudine di funzioni in più legate ad esigenze personali.\n\nCapitolo RAM DDR4 e compatibilità con i processori Ryzen:\nPer la mia configurazione ho scelto 4 banchi di ram DDR4 da 8gb ciascuno con\nfrequenza di 3600Mhz e latenza cl.16 ma perchè?\n\nLa velocità della memoria DDR4 ha un impatto piuttosto marcato sulle prestazioni\ndei sistemi Ryzen,non solo a causa del bandwidth;\nLa frequenza dell'interconnessione Infinity Fabric,la \"rete\" che permette ai vari\ncore e thread (i chip Ryzen sono basati su due CCX con quattro core ciascuno)\ndi \"parlarsi\" e amministrare i carichi,è legata proprio alla frequenza della DRAM.\nA seconda dell'operazione e del core/thread chiamato in causa,può verificarsi una\nlatenza più o meno marcata che impatta sulle prestazioni finali,pertanto la velocità\ndella memoria DDR4 è quindi funzionale a ottenere il meglio dai chip Ryzen.\nAltro aspetto da non sottovalutare è la \"latenza\" delle ram(il valore CL),più è bassa\ne più le ram performano al loro meglio sempre relazionate al discorso di cui sopra,\nsiamo nell' ordine di un 3/5% come indice prestazionale,tuttavia è bene prestarci\nattenzione quando si acquistano,ad oggi le CL16 hanno un buon rapporto prezzo/prestazioni\nrispetto a ram con cl.15 o cl.14,scegliere ram con latenze superiori a cl.16 vanifica\nprestazionalmente frequenze pari o superiori a 3600Mhz,salvo mettere mano al bios per\ntrovare il giusto bilanciamento tra frequenza e latenza.\nMolti siti parlano anche di una sorta di \"lotteria del silicio\" con i Ryzen serie 5000,\nin sintesi attraverso vari parametri in fase di test e tipi di dissipazione applicati\nnon tutti i chip della stessa famiglia e categoria raggiungono o addirittura superano\nle specifiche del produttore,in questo momento i più smanettoni utilizzano un tool creato\nad hoc da alcuni programmatori per testare i propri processori ryzen,questo tool restituisce\ndopo una moltitudine di test legati al carico,frequenza,overclock e temperatura un \"parere\"\nsul tipo di chip testato e ne consigliano i valori da impostare manualmente nel proprio\nbios per poter portare il processore ad una condizione di stabilità e prestazioni\nottimale,è un discorso un pò più complesso di come enunciato ma state certi che di appassionati\nche testano e ne parlano nei vari forum internazionali ce ne sono tantissimi.\nIl tool in questione si chiama: \"Clock Tuner v.2.0\"\ne il risultato dato al mio chip è il seguente:\nDIAGNOSTIC RESULTS\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor\nCPU VID: 1055\nCPU TEL: 1021\nMax temperature: 67,8°\nEnergy efficient: 4,29\nYour CPU is GOLDEN SAMPLE\n💥 in sintesi il massimo del voto! 💥\nin ultimo e poi concludo,come sistema di dissipazione,vi ricordo che il ryzen 7 5800x non ha\nincluso in confezione nessun sistema di dissipazione,ho scelto il DeepCool castle EX 360mm,\ntrattasi di un dissipatore a liquido di tipo AIO con 3 ventole da 120mm non illuminate\n(mi piace la discrezione) e avente una pompa di nuova generazione anti perdite con un anello\nluminoso ARGB all'altezza della cpu con un effetto \"specchio infinito\",non è proprio economico\ntuttavia è molto efficiente ed esteticamente discreto rispetto a soluzioni a Torre di imponenti\ndimensioni ed esteticamente meno eleganti.\nNelle foto allegate si possono vedere le temperature di esercizio durante alcuni stress test con\ncinebench R23,la curva di velocità delle ventole è stata da me impostata per avere una resa\ndissipante proporzionale e crescente in base alle temperature,tuttavia ho rinunciato a qualche\ngrado in meno in condizioni di pieno carico a favore di un rumore meno invasivo in quanto ho il\ncase del pc sulla scrivania ad altezza di orecchio,comunque siamo abbondantemente sotto i limiti\nmassimi dichiarati da AMD.\n\n📦 ⭐Confezione⭐ :\nPremetto che il mio esemplare è stato acquistato sull'Amazon warehouse,quindi usato ma\n\"Ottime condizioni\",me la sono rischiata in quanto l'usato di Amazon ha le stesse garanzie\ndi un prodotto pari al nuovo e mi è andata bene,la scatola era integra come da foto allegate,\nil processore era in perfette condizioni,non presentava nessun residuo di pasta termica ne\naveva alcun piedino piegato,addirittura era presente il bollino adesivo identificativo del\nprocessore e la confezione aveva ancora tutti i sigilli del caso; Grazie e brava Amazon 👍\n\n🚚 ⭐Spedizione⭐ :\nA cura di Amazon,quindi rapida,sicura e conforme agli standard dell'azienda\n\n📉📈 ⭐Considerazioni finali⭐ :\nPraticamente ho già detto tutto quello che pensavo nei commenti sopra,ottimo processore,\nvenendo dalla prima generazione di ryzen(quelli del 2017) il balzo prestazionale è stato\npalesemente evidente,certo tanta potenza e prestazioni hanno comportato un prezzo abbastanza\npiù alto delle precedenti versioni e anche superiore ai diretti concorrenti che stanno giocando\nla carta dei listini prezzi per farsi preferire,tuttavia,se la situazione non fosse così\ndisastrosa in termini di disponibilità,avremmo già visto come in passato una guerra dei prezzi tra\nle due aziende leader,a mio avviso questo processore,ad oggi 21 maggio 2021,sarebbe dovuto costare\ntra i 360 e i 380 euro,ma la scarsa disponibilità come detto è difficile per qualsiasi componente\nlanciato sul mercato in questo anno e 1/2 di pandemia,chi cerca una scheda grafica sà di che parlo.\ntuttavia quà stiamo analizzando questa CPU e per il lavoro svolto da AMD,andando a scalzare anche\nl'ultimo trono di INTEL e cioè l'ambito \"gaming\" è inequivocabile che AMD abbia fatto un \"LAVORONE\"\nSe fate lavoro+gioco+streaming questo è il processore adatto,se volete solo giocare e poco altro senza\nle esigenze di tempi ristretti e prestazioni da top di gamma si può ripiegare anche su un più che valido\nRyzen 5 5600 o ancora meglio un 5600X."

I'm running the factory amd cooler that came with my 2600 but planning on doing a water cooler because this one does run much hotter. Normally with my 2600 I was around 65 while heavy gaming and this guy likes to run around 80, which apparently is completely acceptable for this card, it can run up to 93 or something without loosing performance. I got my little cooler turned up pretty aggressive though so a water cooler will make things alot quieter. All in all its way overkill for my rtx 3070 but will pair nicely with a 40 series card when I decided to upgrade."

        "review": "At the time of writing this CPU has only been 'available' for about 2 weeks and I'll admit I got very lucky in getting one on launch day. Most will probably find this hard to find until demand/supply stabilize but if you're fortunate like me here are some things I have found so far:\n\nThis CPU is a top performer at it's tier. There's a plethora of data at this point in benchmarks about the Ryzen 5000 series and they seem to outscore most of the Intel competitors easily, as well as against the previous Ryzen 3000 series line. Personally I don't think this alone is a great reason to buy this product currently but I will expand later on value, my previous setup was an 8700K and I felt this 'worth' the upgrade for me personally. I use it on a near exclusive gaming PC, with some occasional video rendering and I can see improvement across the board. I play most games at 1440p however, and vs my old 8700k I can tell you the performance gain on average is probably less than 5%. In rendering and workstation benchmarks its much more, to be expected with core count increase.\n\nThis CPU in my system tends to run HOT. At least hotter than I expected @ 105W TDP. I'm on a MSI Tomahawk x570 with an Arctic Liquid Cooler 2 280mm AIO, and with stock settings stress testing I'm reaching 75 C quickly, sometimes maxing at 85 C depending on the task. I've checked my mounting and I don't think there is an issue. My system is using a Phanteks P500A with high airflow as well. I've found examples of others reporting this as well online, and it seems exclusive to the 5800x currently. I've done some extended stress testing and it doesn't seem to thermal throttle so I'm not too worried, while gaming it peaks around 68 C.\n\nOverall I've had zero stability problems or crashes so far which is better than expected as AMD has been known in recent years as a problematic launch platform with driver/BIOS issues. Hopefully this stays the same!\n\nIn terms of value this is probably not worth it to most who are interested. The 5600x is (for now) the value/performance king of the new series and the 5900x has notable advantages for only $100 more. I think there is still fantastic value in the R5 3600 as well, especially since it can be occasionally had for around $175. If the price of the 5800x drops to $400 or less in the future it will be become a much more compelling purchase. Consider that this is also the end of the line (supposedly) for the AM4 platform. I think you can make a reasonable argument for 10th Gen Intel due to a potential next gen upgrade capability but who knows if it will be worth the wait.\n\nTL;DR: Top performer, value questionable, warm running Ryzen CPU. I'm an enthusiast who wanted to buy into this series before we even knew it was capable, most will find this unnecessary for mid-high tier 1440/4k gaming.\n\n*EDIT #1* - For those who are interested, I've done more temperature and benchmark and found that enabling ECO Mode in AMD Ryzen Master software is a fantastic way to mitigate high temps. It seems to drop the total power draw from 145w (PBO/OC mode enabled) to about 88w, maintains the same Single-Core score in Cinebench and has virtually no effect on gaming. Heavy multi-core workloads suffer to the tune of about 10% i.e. Cinebench, Handbrake encoding, etc. This is now my default setting, I've noticed CPU intense games dip a little, but still higher performing than my old 8700K and temps on average are 20% less. This is now my default setting as odd as that sounds, maintains my fan/pump speeds much lower and therefore quieter and for 90% of the 1440p gaming I see no performance effect. Maybe this will be improved with further BIOS updates but for now this seems to be the safest option.\n\n*EDIT #2* At time of writing now I have been using this CPU for about 9 months and I have spent a pretty silly amount of time tinkering with settings, optimizing and looking for possible improvements in my cooling/performance solutions. I am no longer running Eco Mode via Ryzen Master. My BEST CASE results are as follows, YMMV:\n\nIn my MXI X570 BIOS I'm utilizing the following settings found in Advanced AMD Overclocking:\n\nPower limits are Manually set:\nPPT - 142w\nTDC - 95A\nEDC - 120\nBoost Override - 50mhz\n\nCurve Optimizer:\nBest two Cores NEGATIVE 10 (for me this happens to be core 1 and 7, check in Ryzen Master)\nAll other cores NEGATIVE 25\n\nThis gives me my best undervolted temps via the new PBO2 update, 30 minutes of Cinebench R23 Multi peaking @ 78C. Average gaming temps are usually 55C-60C depending on the title. With these settings I'm able to come to within 2-3% of my highest overclock scores while not breaching 80C. I've tested with hours of runs in game with perfect stability as well.\n\nOne last update - if you happen to be using the Arctic Freezer 2 280mm AIO - check which revision you have and if its not Rev. 4 then contact Arctic customer support. They will send you an 'offset' mounting bracket for the cold plate block that positions it about 1 CM lower on the IHS. Sounds pretty useless but I found with the 5800x this resulted in a much slower heat buildup and better overall temps to about 4-5C. It seems like this gets it more centered on the actual heat producing component of the CPU and also happens to make the cooler mount in general much easier. Thanks ARCTIC!"

However this processor runs 6 degree celcius hotter than Ryzen 6 cores processors because of the extra 2 cores. Overall, this processor is highly recommended to be able to handle intensive tasks and heavy gaming!"

He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.\n\nThe 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.\n\nWhile the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.\n\nIf you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."

Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother. It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."

Seal was not broken. No signs of tampering.\nThe performance of the Ryzen 5900X compared to an Ryzen 5700G octacore I have in my other system is not much greater with this Ryzen 5900X. But the price is about 2 times as much and the power draw is 4 times more. At the moment this 5900X draws 100 Watts total system draw on writing this review.\nThere is no difference on gaming between the 5700G and this 5900X. Cinebench gives me on the 5700G around 12000 points (in the Bios the temperature is limited to 75 Degrees Celsius) and the 5900X gives around 18000 points (again temperature limit of 70 Degrees Celsius on the CPU). I limit the max temperature allways to a difference of 20 Celsius to Tjunc temperature.\nAs now the CPU has an temperature of 50 degrees Celsius with the Gamemax Gamma 500 cooler.\nI ordered the MSi B450-A Pro Max motherboard when AM5 came out and paid 80$ for it. A bit expensive but it is an ATX board. Super easy to install and flash with the BIOS button the Bios for the Ryzen 5000 series CPU's. Worked right out of the box. The board is better than the B450 board I have from Asus. Easy to install in my XPG Invader case.\nAt the beginning when freshly installed Windows 11 I got lots of sound problems. After installing the crap of MSi drivers and Utilities which actual version MSi's MSi Center was offering, my sound got messed up completely. Sound stutters becauso of the new sound drivers, Chipset drivers and the like. Headphones and 5.1 Speakers intermittently connected/disconnected causing delays and stutters. Looked like an software issue of MSi software. That foreced me to reinstall and erase from scrap Windows 10 and it offered then to upgrade to Windows 11. After that the problem was gone with only Windows drivers. Do not download the crap MSi Center offers. It can break your OS.\nOther than that this board suggests it has 2 full fledged PCIE x 16 slots of the 3.0 type. At least that is what customers will think easily. Think twice. It has only one x16 PCIE 3.0 slot and the long one below has x16 openings but only half of those have connector pins installed and the manual says it is not even an x8 slot but rather an x4 only. And to add insult to injury that slot is only 2.0. Completely misleading for an new buyer.\nOn the lower slot I have the GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi installed I had still from Q1 2020. It works on low settings on some games like HnG from 2016 and gets between 52 fps and 60 fps.\nOther than that this MSi board works way better than the Asus B450 board I have on my other system from last year. The RAM slots are way easier to use and the sticks slide into them like lubricated. The dual channel works on this board which is on my Asus most likely defective (Asus refuses warranty). I use it with 32 GB (2 x 16) TeamGroup TCreate RAM sticks. High quality 3200 Mhz sticks for relatively cheap.\nIt is a good strong board with 2 massive coolers on the Mosfets. These massive coolers impressed me as an new inexperienced buyer for my very first build. So it slipped to me the issue with the PCIE \"x16\" slots.\nThis Motherboard worked straight out of the box. I use the Ryzen 5900X with this with an Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 cooler. The coolers does not fit well the AM4 system since it's clip is way to stiff so I had to take the cooler off the CPU and bend a bit the clips till it fits just with a little pressure. Install the air coolers without too much pressure so it is not loose but can slide a bit is fine before snapping it gently in place. As original fit I got 66 Celsius to 70 Celsius on idle or doing basic work with that processor, but after bending the clips to aliviate the pressure I get now at the moment 51 Degrees Celsius. So if too much pressure is applied by the cooler onto the processor that rises the heat to a difference of about 20 Degrees Celsius. Any of these standard air coolers with heat pipes will be able to cool the Ryzen 5900X easily. While gaming it gets to about 61 degrees Celsius. My case has 3 fans in the front and 1 in the back.\nMSi's UEFI is a bit confusing if one is used to the Asus UEFI. But it has basically the same features but it is way more confusing. The fans can be adjusted better on MSi's BIOS. But with this 5900X duo deca core CPU, the PSU is annoyingly loud all the time. While on Ecomode with 65 Watts the whole system draws on gaming about 150 Watts. The board seems to have no problems to deliver power to the 5900X.\nRunning Cinebench with this board and 5900X CPU with settings to Ecomode 65Watt, the case fans kick in, the CPU has an temp of 61 Degrees Celsius after 5 Minutes Cinebench, the Mosfets have an temperature of 58 Degrees Celsius and the PCH has an temperature of 50 Celsius while the Cooler Master Silencio 120mm fan I put on the Gamma from GameMax CPU cooler, turns 1000 rpm and all 4 Arctic F12 120mm case fans show an rpm of 700.\nI am surprised how this GameMax Gamma air cooler is able to maintain cool this CPU. So the huge aluminum coolers on the Mosfets of the MSi board sure do their job.\nThe board has lots of fan headers. Thats very good.\nI recommend this board for the AM4 system but be aware of the cheating PCIE slot advertisement, the sound problems and the rather difficult to use UEFI settings. But this is an robust board.\nAfter updating all drivers through MSi Center, updating Windows 11 and running sfc /scannow and DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth command, all Windows errors are corrected and there is no software or hardware problem whatsoever. No sound problems anymore after this and Realtek Audio Console, which comes as software on the MSi Center works wonderfull as well. Realtek Audio Console only works when you install the latest audio drivers from MSi Center (without that it fails to run).\nI am now used to the MSi Bios 5 UEFI over the Asus Bios.\nI have undervolted the 5900X to 0.1 Volts, combined with PBO on auto and the temperature limited to 70 degrees Celsius.\nI had to open my PSU since it ran considerably and annoyingly loud with this 5900X so I changed the PSU fan. I put there an 120mm Gamemax 3-pin fan in, funneled the wires through the PSU grid and plugged it into the motherboards Pump header. Now I can control the PSU fan in the Bios as well and it runs normally at 900 rpm )(blows now as much or more air out of the back of the PSU and the air is never hot at all, just a bit warmer after 10 minutes Cinebench which draws 200 Watts while running) and the CPU fan runs at 887 rpm. The system is whisper quiet. PSU fans tend to run at 100% speed on normal load with these 5900X and 5950X CPU's so that is an unbearingly loud and annoying sound. I allmost desperated because of this till I changed the PSU fan. I have in this new built an 600 Watt PSU and an GT 1030 GPU. The case fans allmost never run and spin up only after 62 degrees Celsius.\nTill date the CPU works as it should.\nHowever I believe the 5900X is overpriced since I paid 336 US$ for it. It should be only around 200 US$ and the 5950X should be around 300 USD. The Ryzen 5950X is insanely overpriced since any 7900X or 7950X you can cool with an air cooler as well if you trade a bit of performance. Then again I trade with this as well performance with my temp limits and with this cooler.\nFor the same price I would suggest go for the Ryzen 7950X, apply an 70 degrees Celsius temp limit and cool it just with an air cooler like the Thermalright Peerless Assasin.\nI did not select XMP for the RAM but rather just manually put the speed at it's rated speed of 3200 Mhz and the rest on auto.\nThe Bios does somehow not update on the MSi software or in the Bios so I updated it manually with the Bios flash button which this motherboard has on the back of the I/O to the latest stable version.\nFor flashing the nevest Bios on this motherboard you download manually the Bios from MSi website. extract all files and select the one file (not the text file) and change the name to MSI.ROM. Then format an USB stick to FAT32 and copy there the MSI.ROM file. No other data should be on the USB stick. Then put power to the system not pressing the power button and stick the USB drive in the USB port below the Bios flash button. Press the Bios Flash button on the back for about 5 seconds till a light start to blink and leave it doing it's thing. There will show up 2 lights blinking in an different pace and the USB drive light will show movement as well if it has one. Only take out the USB stick 5 minutes till all lights are out and the system has sort of resumed (case fans will stop and start again. You will hear a sort of resetting the Bios). Then the Bios is upgraded via Flash button mode.\nIf this Processor should become old after 15 years, then put Tuxedo OS or some other Linux in it or Chrome OS. That will give it's some snappy internet browsing life at least till 2060 Anno Domini.\nInstalling the Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 CPU cooler I had to bend it's snap over hooks a bit down with an hammer and plier since at the first install it seemed to me way to much pressed onto the CPU. So I adjusted the tension of the snap over assembly 3 times till it had some tension but not much (no sliding on the CPU but a gentle press onto the CPU). If the air cooler is to much pressed onto the CPU I got 67 degrees Celsius on idle - adjusted right and spread nice the thermalpaste with an spatula, I get 49 degrees Celsius on idle. These AM4 snap over clip cooler assemblies sometimes need a bit adjustment (unscrew it from the cooler and flatten the bendings of the arms with a plier or hammer it flatter). Originally even with all my body weight I allmost could not get the snaps over the hooks on the cooler and motherboard plastic ears. That was not normal and I bet the chinese did not bend the snap over arms right for AM4. It has to fit gentle and not with all body weight put that cooler onto the AM4 system. Be ready to adjust things if not deemed right - instead of breaking the motherboard or CPU."

        "review": "This is an absolute beast of a CPU.\n\nI bought this to upgrade my B450 system from a Ryzen 5 2600.\n\nFirst thing I did was check my boards compatibility with this chip, luckily, the BIOS was quite a lot newer than when support was added, so I didn't need to do any updates. If you do though, make sure you do it before you install this CPU.\n\nI, really, didn't think I'd feel that big of a performance improvement. Boy was I wrong...\n\nI put the CPU into \"eco mode\" through the BIOS (it was under AMD Overclocking on my ASUS Prime B450 board), as I'm only using a Noctua NH-U12S as a cooler. I plan to eventually get a more capable cooler, but this is working just fine, CPU is peaking out at 65C in eco mode with the single tower Noctua, pretty impressive if you ask me.\n\nMy Ryzen 5 2600 ran around the same temps under load, and idled in the 40s, this idles a bit higher, but it doesn't really get much warmer than idle from what I can tell, at least with my system configuration.\n\nWhile I was removing my previous CPU it was actually \"stuck\" to the cooler. It actually popped right out of the socket... at first I was a bit worried that I may have accidentally broken something but... i apparently got very lucky. No pins were damaged on the old CPU, and it booted up fine in another system I tested it in.\n\nNew CPU installation was very easy, just line up the triangle to the corner on the socket with a triangle, after opening the clamp bar of course. The clamp bar easily went back into place, and held the new CPU just fine. *Whew*\n\nAt first I thought I may have damaged the motherboard, but... I took this as a chance to do a good cleaning of the inside of my case, and when I put the system back together... I forgot to plug in the GPU power cable *doh*. After plugging that back in, the system rebooted about 1000 times (got to love ASUS boards!), and then asked me if I wanted to overwrite the fTPM settings. I did, I run Linux and I don't use the fTPM. If you're running Windows 11, you may want to go through whatever procedure you need to go through to save this. You'll need it. You need to do this while your old CPU is installed though, or you'll have to go through the whole process of putting it back in if you don't! Luckily, I didn't need to, but be aware of this.\n\nAfter wiping the fTPM settings and a few thousand more reboots (exaggerating a bit, it was probably 10 total, ASUS boards really like to do that), I was presented with a screen that said a new CPU was detected, and that all BIOS settings were cleared. Cool! So far so good!\n\nI spent some time going through and reenabling my RAM speed profile (got to make full use of the 128GB of 3200MHz RAM I installed yesterday!), turning virtualization back on, and enabling eco mode (I didn't want to get a new cooler right now if I could get away with it). Enabling eco mode did bring the CPU temp down about 10 degrees in the BIOS, and from reading around the internet, doesn't really seem to impact performance *that* much. Easier than fiddling with undervolting settings I'd say...\n\nAfter finally getting booted back up into my OS... I was actually kind of impressed already. Just from the increase in boot speed alone I already knew this was going to be good. It wasn't *slow* on my 2600 at all, it's still a very capable chip, but wow, this blows it out of the water.\n\nI've been working on a rust project lately, it compiles in about... 45-55 seconds on my 2600... I did the same project compile on the 5900X? 6 seconds. Even in eco mode. Wow oh mighty. The power of 6 more cores and a dozen more threads.\n\nI also run a Windows VM for several income producing applications (y'know, we all got to work, otherwise we can't buy these fancy new pieces of sand we send lightning through), and wow. Oh boy wow. Like I said, the 2600 wasn't *slow* by any stretch of the imagination, but the responsiveness and speed now is just absolutely incredible. The VM boots so much faster, every application is up and running almost instantly... and that's with only 6 cores dedicated to it...\n\nIf you've got an older AM4 system. Buy this. Buy this before they stop making them. Buy this, and upgrade your BIOS if you need to. Just get it. Seriously. This is a monumental leap in performance that will *absolutely* extend the life of your AM4 system by several years. This is *far* cheaper than building a new AM5/DDR5 system, and you will be absolutely blown away by the performance increase.\n\nFor $350 as of the time of this writing... it's worth every penny. Best performance upgrade I've ever made, for sure."

Ovviamente dipende anche dal dissipatore che viene montato che nel mio caso è un Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML240L V2 RGB. Ci sono sicuramente dissipatori migliori. Uso il pc principalmente per giocare e al momento mi ritengo molto soddisfatto del rapporto qualità prezzo pur essendo consapevole che esistono processori migliori. Nel momento in cui scrivo ho da pochi minuti finito una sessione su StarCitizen. E nella stanza in cui è collocato il pc ci sono circa 29 gradi. Ah dimenticato attualmente il processore ha un over clock fatto automaticamente con il software di AMD. Senza le temperature scendono intorno ai 38 gradi. In foto allego anche la velocità delle ventole che, a questi RPM, non danno nessun fastidio perché il \"rumore\" è minimo.

On the other hand, it was a very expensive upgrade due to the stupidly high early adopter tax. I also had to buy two new modules of M.2 (pcie) SSD's because AM5 does not support sata based M.2. A very expensive investment indeed.\n\nBack to the 7700X. I am very happy. It is definitely faster than my 5800X and notably more snappy in various programs such as video editing and gaming. I can believe AMD's claims that it is 13% faster than the 5800X.\n\nI do not understand why some people (I will come back to this) are complaining about it being too hot, etc. Yes, it does run hot (but so does 12 and 13 gen intel), but the 7700X is nowhere as hot as intel.\nWhen I had PBO and auto-OC activated for my 5800X, the Noctua industrial fans on my air cooler were running at full pelt and sounded like a jet engine. The 5800X also ran hot, at up to 70c. In the end, I deactivated PBO and auto-OC to get far better thermals and acoustics (but at a cost of somewhat decreased performance).\n\nThe 7700X did run hot under load with PBO and auto-OC turned on, as I saw temperatures go up to 57c on tasks. With gaming, it would go up to 65c (depending on the game). At idle, my 7700X would sit at circa 45c.\n\nAfter a bit of tinkering in BIOS and disabling PBO and auto-OC, my 7700X is currently sitting at a very comfortable and constant 35c. This is with a single tower air cooler and two fans (same cooling solution as with my 5800X).\n\nAlso, during activated PBO and auto-OC, my fans were only intermittently running like jet engines and then would calm down (7700X). With these two features deactivated, my Arctic Freezer Esport34 duo air cooler is now running almost silently.\n\nTo summarise, my 7700X is definitely running cooler and faster than my previous 5800X under different BIOS scenarios and work loads.\n\nNote - For the very first time, AMD has included a built in (integrated) graphics chip for 7 series Ryzen (including my 7700X). I have not yet tested the iGPU, but I will in due course, when the time is right. I will then update my review.\n\nMoving on, particularly to one individual who posted a review on 07/10/22 and was whining about the cost of the 7700X and heat output. Yes the release MSRP for the 7700X is over-priced at between £430 and £440 in UK, whilst it is selling for $400 in USA (when the 5800X was released, the UK msrp was £400).\n\nIMHO, the 7700X should not be more than £380. Sadly, the current high price is mostly due to the atrocious state of the british economy, with some good old fashioned price gouging thrown in for good measure.\n\nI also remember when Zen1 was released in March 2017, the 1800X (which I purchased) was retailing for £500, the 1700X at £400 and 1700 non-X at £340.\n\nThis individual was also whining about the supposedly bad physical design for Ryzen 7K series cpu as the metal lid is sitting c.4mm higher on the actual chip. He claimed the thermal paste kept dripping down the sides of the metal plate and it was so bad that Noctua were forced to release an AM5 cpu guard (NATPG1).\n\nFrom my own experience, I have had no such issues whatsoever. So this dribbling TP problem comes down to user error and especially competency (more specifically, lack thereof). Mind you, I have been building pc's since March 2007, so I have a lot of experience.\n\nHurdygurdy then concluded that Ryzen-7 and X670 is very difficult to justify at such absurdly hiked up msrp. He even stated that entry level X670 was grossly over priced at £500 and concluded he would be migrating back to intel, bearing in mind the imminent release of Raptor Lake.\n\nPlease ignore his review as he is clearly an intel fanboy. First of all, who shells out >£1K for an AM5 platform and then decides he does not like it, due to high msrp and heat issues?. If you did not like the price of AM5 and 7700X, then why did you supposedly buy it in the first place?.\n\nSecondly, entry level AM5 mobos do not cost £500. In fact, my top dog Gigabyte Aorus Master X670E cost £500. The entry level X670-P mobo msrp starts at £268. The entry level X670E mobo msrp start at £300.\n\nLet me put things in perspective by now comparing the 7700X (8c/16t) to intel Raptor Lake. The 13700K Raptor Lake (8 Performance cores/16t with 8 economy cores/8t) costs £500 and the last generation 12700K Alder Lake (8c/16t) costs £416. This is in stark contrast to the new architecture 7700X which cost £430. So if you want the 13700K, that is an extra £70 you have to shell out. But is it worth the extra expenditure?. I will come to that later on.\n\nAs mentioned, my AM5 mobo cost £500 and if I look at exactly the same brand/model mobo but for intel platform (Gigabyte Aorus Master, Z790, LGA 1700), then it is costing £620. For around the £500 price point, I am seeing the mid range Z790-F for £480. So the same tier intel mobo is £120 more expensive. Again, is it worth the extra expenditure?.\n\nIMHO, it most definitely is not as the Gigabyte AM5 and Z790 variants have very similar features.\nThe only price advantage that the Z790 has over AM5 is that it is compatible with DDR4 and DDR5, whereas AM5 is compatible only with DDR5. TBH, I purchased from Amazon, a Crucial 16GB DDR5 module for £64. So not bad at all.\n\nIn terms of benchmark comparisons, according to WCCFTECH, RGT, etc the 7700X is virtually on par with the last gen 5900X (12c/24t). That is a very good performance upgrade.\n\nAccording to Hardware Times, the 7700X narrowly beats the i7-13700K in gaming, but the 7700X is slightly slower in (synthetic) content creation.\n\nAccording to benchmarks by Hardware unboxed, the 13700K is only 3% to 7% faster than the 7700X in gaming (dependent on different games) and about 4% to 10% faster in productivity (depending on different productivity tasks).\n\nUltimately, it comes down to buyer preference. I see no benefit is shelling out c. £200 more for an intel platform.\n\nOn hindsight, I should have upgraded my 5800X to a 5900X (£330 new in June 2022). This would have been the cheapest and most convenient upgrade option. I could then sit tight and wait for the MSRP of AM5 and Ryzen-7 to drop down to a more palatable level (Q1-23), bearing in mind Zen4 global sales have been very poor due to the high prices of Zen4, AM5 mobos and having to migrate to expensive DDR5 RAM. As a result, AMD has made the decision to cut back Zen4 production in order to keep msrp artificially high (instead of maintaining Zen4 production and reducing msrp to sensible levels, which would encourage consumer purchasing). AMD is now adopting the same policies as intel and nvidia."

Having 8 cores/16 threads capable of boosting to 5500MHz makes such a difference to smooth gaming, but stress it and each core will try to go as fast as it can until it thermally throttles at 95 deg C. Consequently a single tower air cooler will struggle. I was planning to buy the 7700 but the 7700X (very slightly faster but hotter) was £20 cheaper at the time of purchase. I will be undervolting it as I simply dont need that little bit of additional performance at the expense of a lot more heat, but its nice to have it in reserve for the future.\nThere are faster chips on the market for gaming and multitasking - the 7800X3D or the I7-13700K, but honestly I don't render animations or compile code or stream games all day long for a living, and I cannot afford an RTX4090 so getting the very fastest CPU possible is moot. Also, I wanted a clear upgrade path, and buying Intel usually means a new motherboard with each new CPU generation, so I nailed my colours to the AM5 mast this time around.\nOne last tip - when applying your cooling solution, I advise carefully spreading your thermal paste before you place the cold plate or air cooler into position. The AM5 IHS has \"legs\", and if you make sure your cooler has good thermal contact with the tops of the legs in addition to the centre of the IHS, it can only help keep temps down."

Pues sí, así es, aunque a cambio su rendimiento se verá ligeramente afectado... Y, al menos a mi, no me parece muy normal comprar un procesador y limitar su rendimiento, por poco que sea, para que funcione a unas temperaturas mínimamente aceptables... ( tampoco mucho mas aceptables ).\nOtra cosa que no me termina de convencer es la forma de funcionar de estos Ryzen y que ya era similar en los anteriores. Concretamente los continuos \"spikes\" o \"picos\" de frecuencia a la que funcionan los núcleos del procesador y por consiguiente también picos de temperatura y acelerones de los ventiladores del refrigerador, que por muy silenciosos que sean, llega a apreciarse y es bastante molesto en un entorno silencioso.\nPor último, el consumo del que tanto se habla últimamente... Pues bien, si hipotéticamente tuvieses tu procesador trabajando al 100%, tu Ryzen consumiría menos que un Intel de características similares...PERO, cuánto tiempo tienes el procesador trabajando al 100% y cuánto tiempo en lo que se llama \"idle\" o mínimamente activo? Pues para el uso típico de un usuario medio, el procesador va a estar en \"idle\" muchísimo mas tiempo que trabajando a tope, y en ese estado, el Intel va a consumir mucho menos... No lo digo yo ( que también, porque lo he comprobado ) sino todos los test que se han hecho al respecto y que decidí investigar al ver el alto consumo de este 7700X en reposo o \"idle\".\nNo me enrollo mas. Aun estoy en duda si quedarme con él o devolverlo y cambiarlo por un Intel como por ejemplo el i5-13500, que siendo mas barato, gracias a su mayor cantidad de núcleos, en productividad está mas o menos a la altura de este Ryzen 7700X."

The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable."

        "review": "I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.\n\nSome background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought \"Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile.\" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem \"Premium\" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...\n\nIf you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.\n\nTL:DR\nUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.\nUpgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.\nParts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)\n\nPros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!\n\nCons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).\n\nI hope this review helps people!"

A pretty huge step up from my fx-8300 in my homelab setup.\n\nOnly issue was the CPU did not seat into the socket, pin inspection did not seem to have a bent pin, but upon very close inspection one pin was ever so slightly tilted. Was able to bend it back with a plastic shim and the socket helped guide it straight."

Le informazioni relativamente importanti sono contrassegnate da \">>\".\n\nAcquistai questo prodotto nel lontano 2022, in una giornata piovosa di Ottobre.\nEro seduto nella mia sedita a non fare una mazza, osservando ben bene il mio ormai obsoleto i3 8100 che ormai mi sopportava e chiedeva pietà dal lontanissimo 2018.\nDopo essermi recato all'ufficio postale più vicino a versare una somma di denaro pari al prezzo del prodotto sulla mia PosteItaliane® PostePay™ Evolution (Black) (Yellow outlines), tornai alla mia abitazione (con l'ombrello perché mannaggia pioveva un botto).\nDopo aver ordinato l'articolo per una somma di denaro pari a euro 151.00, il mio i3 8100 ebbe finalmente un sospiro di sollievo (non sapendo che dopo sarebbe finito nel pc di mio padre lmao).\nAbbinai questo processo(re) alla fantomatica scheda madre Asrock® B550M Steel Legend™, che arrivò due settimane dopo perché ✨mannaggia a GLS✨.\nDopo essermi reso conto che l'intero insieme dell'hardware a mia disposizione non sarebbe stato la migliore delle idee con questa nuova combo CPU e MOBO, decisi di acquistare altri 250 prodotti diversi (come solito al mondo del PC gaming), riuscendo infine ad arrivare ad una configurazione di mio gradimento (6700 XT goes brrrr).\n\nPossiamo parlare dell'articolo (!).\n\nSike.\nLa scatola emana potenza. La scritta AMD è molto grande e visibile alle persone con problemi visivi.\nIl processore è visibile al lato della scatola in tutta la sua MASSA.\nAprendolo, avremo una sorpresa: una tecnologia talmente avanzata che risulta essere necessaria assieme al nostro processore: un dissipatore AMD® Wraith™ Stealth, consigliabile per un utilizzo non paragonabile al mio. Tale dissipatore deve sopportare il mio PBO a 105W. (Sono povero) (Amazon Vine pls take me in I need a new CPU cooler thx).\n\nIl dissipatore AMD® Wraith™ Stealth risulta essere un discreto prodotto capace di \"dissipare\" il nostro processore in carichi relativamente leggeri come il gaming. Generalmente, la CPU non andrà in thermal throttling sotto tale sistema di dissipazione, pur essendo leggermente rumoroso.\n(TL;DR: funziona fa casino lmao)\n\nPossiamo parlare dell'articolo (!). PT2\nNot Sike.\nIl 5600 è un 5600X copypastato con 200MHz in meno di clock.\nFine recensione.\n\nAnother sike.\nPossiamo notare nella parte inferiore dell'articolo la presenza di numerosi CHIODI METALLICI, comunemente chiamati pin, che permettono l'interlacciamento tra il nostro amato processore e una scheda madre possibilmente AM4 compatibile (Highly recommended se non volete usarlo come fermacarte).\n\n>> Vi servirà un firmware UEFI con AGESA 1.2.0.7, altrimenti noterete il nulla cosmico nel vostro monitor (collegato possibilmente alla porta HDMI o DisplayPort della scheda video di vostra scelta) e avrete di conseguenza un fermacarte pur avendo una scheda madre compatibile.\nAGGIORNATEVI IL BIOS !. Dovrebbe essere supportato su ogni scheda madre AM4. Tranne alcune B350 se il vostro produttore non risulta essere una brava persona.\n\nNella parte superiore dell'articolo troveremo la scritta Ryzen 5 5600 che ci conferma ancora una volta che purtroppo non avete ricevuto un 5800X3D. Nei lati è presente del metallo.\n\n>> Una volta montato il vostro PC e installato il sistema operativo di vostra scelta, è altamente consigliabile, nel caso usiate Windows, l'installazione dei Chipset Drivers DAL SITO UFFICIALE AMD. Se avete una B550, vi basterà cercare \"B550 Chipset Drivers\".\n\n- A chi è adatto questo processore?\nA chi ha i soldi.\nA chi non ha troppi soldi.\nA chi ha abbastanza soldi e vuole giocare in grazia di Dio.\nSe avete un utilizzo mediamente intensivo, questo processore fa per voi:\nNon avrete problemi di bottleneck su qualsiasi scheda grafica dedicata al 1440P. Nel mio caso, con una 6700 XT risulta essere un ottimo abbinamento.\nAvete una 6800? Va bene\nAvete una 4090? Compratevi il 13900K e non state dietro alle CPU da 150€ (dopo averne speso 2500 di GPU).\n\n- Overclocking\n👍\n\nPBO2 funziona che una meraviglia: -20 sul Curve VCore e + 200MHz per me è stata una configurazione stabile. Arriva tranquillamente ai livelli del 5600X stock con un po' di tuning.\n\n- Consumi, TDP, robe\nSenza overclocking, non consuma una mazza, 70W di picco forse al 100% di carico. In gaming 35 probabilmente.\nCon overclocking inizia a farsi sentire, 105W di picco massimo nel mio caso. Nulla di ingestibile in ogni caso dal dissipatore stock.\n\nNon avete soldi per un 7600X, B650 e DDR5? Fa assolutamente al caso vostro.\nCredo sia definitivamente best buy considerato il costo attuale della piattaforma AM4, aggiunto ai costi ormai insignificanti delle ram DDR4."

The motherboard being used here is an ASRock B450M A/C R-2.0.\n\nI have just upgraded the RAM now too and endeavor to see what the performance difference is with faster-clocked RAM versus the older RAM speeds on the 5600 that were same as what the Ryzen 7 1700 was running at."

If you are gaming under 144hz and on a budget this is easily one of the best you can get from this generation.\n\nThis is continually one of, if not the highest, value cpu's as it comes with a very beefy performance for its cost and a cooler all in one package.\n\nI had near-flawless performance when used on my 144hz 1440p monitor in most of my games. I generally reduce in-game settings to accommodate higher framerate which does often reduce CPU load as well but reducing max framerates to 120 and more-so 90 at comparable settings would be even more ideal if going for higher settings or a smoother 1% framerate experience for fast games.\n\nProductivity - I had two monitors and often I watch videos, streamers, chat with friends and browse(browsers can be quite CPU intensive at times due if not using hardware-encoding which in my case I did not due to compatibility issues with other software)\n\nAll-in-all if you are building a new system, you may want to look at the newer AMD 7600 lineup as it is very similar, but if squeezing out a smaller budget with a very good sale or a used purchase, the 5600 will last you at minimum 4 years without issue."

Even on Escape From Tarkov at max settings 4k 140+ fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0-1 percent, I don't know if it's my computer reading an error but I use a few apps to check including the task manager tab. I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail, Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage. My GPU barely works as I have a 3090 TI, my GPU is usually at USAGE 40-50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool, so I don't think anything is bottle necking.\n\nMy old computer has an I5 and I have a laptop with an I7 and when I am gaming they are usually at 90+ percent usage. Even my friend with the AMD 5800x3D was getting at least 30+percent usage for AAA games. This is the first Computer I've built where I'm actually not even worried about the CPU for how cool it runs.

        "review": "I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.\n\nI came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.\n\nOdds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.\n\nAnd they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.\n\nThe out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.\n\nAll in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it."

        "review": "i upgraded from 5900xt. I got the msi board z690 -a for 159, and this the 13900kf. I ‘ve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldn’t justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu.\n\nmy use case is productivity. i’m a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. It’s pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped. Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable.\n\nHeat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean it’s fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30’s. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right.\n\nAbout the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5-- i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though. I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5.\n\nPrice: For 570 it’s decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700.\n\nI do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject. with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a 300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade.\n\nTips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. don’t worry about the vrm. that’s also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming. I just really love the layout connectivity and features of the board. They cut all the stuff i don't need and pared with the cpu it's all together about 700 for a cpu and board, pretty much as good as you can get."

        "review": "Concerning Intel Core i9-13900KF,\n\nI have this CPU with board ASUS ROG Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi 6E LGA 1700 for gaming usage. Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test). Just checking the XMP II box, the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal. I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable. My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice). I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare.\n\nI am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360 AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot. The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out. It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test. While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test. I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W. Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering.\n\nFWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test. If you want to run this CPU all out with reasonable temps, you really need significant cooling. I doubt any AIO will work for this. I suggest an open loop system with something like a Watercool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator.\n\nAll said, If you are building a gaming system, you would be just as well served with a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E and a i9-12900KF CPU. It will be easier to cool and will save you some money for a better graphics card which will make *much* more difference in most games than the CPU."

I'll take the 5600 for $130 Bob.\n\nWhile this is a Zen 3 CPU, it's not PCIe gen4 and you should be aware of this before buying. It's not the same line of CPU that most Zen 3 CPUs which are Vermeer. This is Cezanne. There are 3 Cezanne CPUs, the other two are OEM only, meaning they only come in a PC you buy from a company that makes PCs like Dell, etc........ For the most part this isn't a problem because it's a budget CPU, however if you pair this with something like an AMD Radeon 6500 XT which only uses 4 PCIe lanes to connect to the CPU, you'll get bad performance. So don't do that.\n\nOtherwise as long as you pair this with at least an 8 PCIe lane GPU it works fine. You take a tiny hit in GPU performance but not enough to worry about.\n\nThe bigger hit comes with the NVMe drives, especially in 2023 and going forward. There are now MANY NVMe disks that are a lot faster than 4GB/s, and to give as simple explanation as I can, a PCIe lane is a serial data line. The way a PCIe device/bus works is by grouping a certain amount of lanes so that you get the speed of a single PCIe lane times the number of lanes you have. Any NVMe disk has 4 lanes. It also means the port you plug it into along with what it connects to (CPU, motherboard chipset) has 4 PCIe lanes that it will connect with. So, you get 4 PCIe lanes. So now you need to know the data speed for each lane. For PCIe gen3, the speed of each lane is 1GB/s. For PCIe gen4 the speed of each lane is 2GB/s. So, with this CPU, the best you can get is a data transfer rate of 4GB/s to an NVMe disk. That's it. The newest disks coming out the end of 2022, and 2023 can hit speeds near 9GB/s. Now, most data transfers to/from NVMe disks can't run at that speed. However many disks can run many data transfers faster than 4GB/s, so that means a CPU that runs PCIe gen3 is slowing down modern NVMe disks that can run gen4 or now gen5 speeds. But that's not a statement that has a clear meaning, because just because a disk is called gen4, it doesn't mean most of the data transfers to/from that disk will run at the full bandwidth of PCIe gen4 x4 lanes = 8GB/s. Most gen4 disks rarely hit that speed if ever. Only the most expensive ones do. BUT once again many will run different types of transfers above 4GB/s.\n\nSo that's the description of what it means to have PCIe gen3 when dealing with modern NVMe disks. You're going to slow down some of the data transfers, not all, depending on how fast (which also means more expensive) the disk is.\n\nYes for a general purpose PC build this is good enough and it's a low cost option that's really good at $100 USD or less. However if the price of this starts to get closer to the Ryzen 5600, I'd rather buy the 5600 because that's PCIe gen4 which is as good as it gets with an AMD AM4 motherboard."

        "review": "This is a great CPU for general use and budget/mid-range gaming! It's able to keep up with all my computing tasks and when gaming with my AMD RX6700XT. Seriously I am very impressed. I will say that when I first installed it, the CPU was running a little warm, but nothing too bad and after a few days it seemed to settle down and now typically sits around 55-65 degrees even while gaming/computing in this hot SoCal summer. I generally see about 20% to 30% usage while playing pretty recent games on 1440p and ultra quality. Would I prefer a 5600x, 5700x or 5800x? Of course, but for the price, nothing beats the value of this CPU and I'm just not willing to spend double the price on relatively limited performance increases. As long as you're not planning to do some extremely CPU-heavy tasks or overclocking, this CPU should fit your needs perfectly. The Wraith Stealth cooler is a nice free add-on as well, although I would suggest if you're looking for ultimate performance, you might want to contemplate a tower air cooler or AIO. However, the Wraith is more than adequate by itself. Anyway, I can't recommend this CPU enough. Keep in mind though, if you're used to Intel CPUs which typically come with integrated graphics, this CPU does not (only G series AMD CPUs like the 5600G for example include integrated graphics although they don't perform as CPUs as well as non G series), so you'll have to buy a graphics card. Also keep in mind X series CPUs like the 5600x are for extreme overclocking (I would go easy on overclocking non-X CPUs and for a lower ranged CPU like this one I would not recommend any overclocking at all). Hope that helps with your decision! Thanks for reading"

It's powerful yet efficient. Honestly, unless you're a content creator, unlikely you need more than six cores. I can't even get this thing to break a sweat in productivity (I work from home) and games. Highly recommend.\n\nNOTE THOUGH: The one I got from Amazon was faulty. Probably just bad luck. But if your computer randomly resets, has memory errors (but none while using MemTest86 at stock), or ever freezes in the BIOS, return the chip and try again. I wasted so much time returning motherboards and RAM kits when it was the chip all along. Got my second chip from NewEgg and it worked fine."

At idle the CPU runs around 55-60deg C. My motherboard is stock configured to run the CPU fan at 70% at 60deg C temperature. With the included cooler + case fans the CPU can sustain 4.8 GHz boost on all cores with 100% load. The max boost speed of the CPU is 5.1 GHz. 4.8 GHz boost under sustained load on all cores seems OK to me although you could probably get a bit more performance with a better cooler. Under any considerable load the CPU runs at 95deg C, which to my understanding is what it's designed to do. Outside of gaming and code compilation the CPU rarely goes above idle speeds though."

While the On-Board graphics is powerful enough to do light gaming and basic office work It's only a Radeon Graphics APU, Meaning anything released in the last 15 years is probably outside of it's capabilities with exception to some online games (Runescape, League of Legends, ect). That's not really why you would want to buy this for a gaming computer, You could have a processor with more raw power and more L2/L3 Cache that would definitely do better, but... having onboard graphics is sort of like a spare tire. When a GPU inevitably breaks it's nice to be able to hop along and still use your computer until you get a replacement. It's for this reason I bought this processor, my GPU may break & I may or may not be able to buy another graphics card based on current prices (Things have gotten crazy on the GPU market.... most people can't afford mid-range GPU's anymore) I love my computer but I'm not that wealthy, having onboard graphics as a spare tire is infinitely more valuable than 5% increase in performance, Don't let that fool you though this APU is a powerhouse of AM4 Architecture and compared to my 2700x It's really fast, with higher turbo frequencies and a much lower TDP, It can still be overclocked (granted voiding your warranty in the process) for when you want to squeeze even more juice out of it. Overall it's a great CPU and I highly recommend it for anyone who can't upgrade to AM5 yet (All AM5's have built in graphics)"

PS : pensez à activer l'XMP.\n\nEn revanche pour les petites config gaming (autour de 500 euros) sans carte graphique dédiée, j'aurai plutôt tendance à vous recommander le 5600G, dont les perfs graphiques et en jeu sont quasi similaires, seule la puissance brute varie (d'environ 30%), et de 60 euros en moyenne moins cher.\nPour les grosses config (> à 1000 euros), partez plutôt sur un 5600X ou un 5700X (et pour des config gaming entre 600 et 1000 euros, le 5600 tout court est top !!!).\n\nPour le refroidissement, le Wraith Sleath intégrée à cet version boxed est limite... on atteint les 85 degrés lors des grosses charges. Un ventirad doté de minimum 4 caloducs est donc recommandé pour ménager la durée de vie de cet APU.\n\nCôté carte mère, une B450 est recommandée, attention, il faudra mettre à jours le BIOS.\nUne B550 est également compatible avec MàJ du BIOS, mais celle-ci sont plus couteuses, et n'apportent rien de plus, cet APU se limitant à du PCIe 3.0, contre 4.0 pour les 5000 et 5000x (à prendre en compte si on veut faire du gaming).\n\n- Parenthèse overclocking -\n\nL'overclocking de cet APU est top. Il est facile, apporte beaucoup, et très stable ! Par contre ça chauffe et consomme plus du coup (Passé à 120w de conso pour +10% de perfs). Mais surtout le must, c'est l'overclocking de l'iGPU ! Je l'ai passé à 2400MHz, et j'ai gagné 15% de fps !\nDe plus, l'iMC dans cet APU est excellent, la RAM tourne bien même overclockée, même sur 4 rank, et même sur une CM Daisy-Chain !\n\nRésumé :\n\nLes plus :\n\n- puissance brute\n- efficacité énergétique\n- rapport perfs/prix (pour 230 euros environ)\n- la partie graphique convaincante\n- l'overclocking fantastique !\n\nLes moins :\n\n- le ventirad\n- le manque de cache (=> pas ouf pour du gaming)\n- la concurrence avec le 5600G, et les 5000X*\n- l'absence de PCIe 4.0 (que du 3.0)\n\nRecommandé pour :\n\nDe la bureautique poussée.\n\nDéconseillé pour :\n\nDu gaming.\n\nVoili voilou fin du pavé ;)"

Il lato migliore è dato dal fatto che ha una GPU integrata (Radeon Vega) in grado di offrire un adeguato framerate anche ad alte risoluzioni con livelli di dettaglio medio. In più la presenza di una architettura 8 core /16 thread ne consente un suo utilizzo anche per supportare carichi di lavoro pesanti.\n\nStiamo parlando quindi di un processore di fascia medio-alta pensato per configurazioni office con heavy workload, media center o gaming di fascia bassa (se usato con la GPU integrata, medio-alta se usato per supportare una GPU dedicata)\n\nIo personalmente ho acquistato questa APU per realizzare una postazione di lavoro tipo \"workstation\" dove sfrutto la potenza del processore per far girare qualche machina virtuale per la generazione/gestione di servizi home (quindi con un po' di disco e tanta RAM). La configurazione è la seguente:\n\n- Asrock B450 Steel Legend (Bios Aggiornato)\n- 4x16GB Corsair LPX 3600 CL18\n- 2 x Crucial P2 1TB NVME,\n- Thermalright SI-100\n- Case SilverStone Grandia GD09\n- Corsair TX650W Modulare\n- 3 x 120 Arctic P12\n- 2 x 80 Arctic P8\n- 1 Fan Controller Lamptron FC5\n\nPer l'utilizzo che ne faccio che dire ... ottimo ottimo ottimo!!!"

Anything cheaper saw sharp reductions in performance. I also paired him with a fairly quality $99 mITX board from gigabyte and the system is overkill for what I needed it for.\n\nIn 2022 the Intel i3 12100 (The later 13100 is more or less the same in performance and price) really tried to move in on the 4600g's spot. Now in 2023 the price difference is only around $15 and the intel does give a little better cpu performance, but if you were also interested in the gaming performance of the built in iGPU you will find the Vega7 graphics are a bit better. Not only in performance but also at the driver level, the AMD will offer significantly less bugs over intel. If you are looking to pair up with an external graphics card however the intel is probably better.\n\nThe cost of a MiniITX for the intel will also add an additional $15 at least (And this may go up, I found when I wanted to use some older intel processors in mITX builds the motherboards were all oldstock and significantly marked up). So the final build should you go with AMD should be cheaper, too."

I did not want to go through the expense of upgrading my motherboard to support the newer generation of AM5 CPUs and so the best option I could find was a significant jump (in price) to the Ryzen 9 5950X.\n\nMoving from a Ryzen 7 3700X to a Ryzen 9 5950X netted a 25% performance boost in my 3D rendering workflow. While the price-tag seems a bit steep for only 25% I am comfortable with the cost due to lowered render times. Imagine cutting 1h from a 4h render - every time.\n\nI found that my CPU cooler (wraith prism) was not really able to keep up with the Ryzen 9 5950X under full-load and thermal throttling was observed. I've since moved to an MSI P360 AIO water-cooling system because water cooling offers more smoothing of heat cycles as compared to air-cooling which needs to throttle up and down as the load modulates. The net result is less fan spin-up/spin-down noise as well as less high-rate temperature cycling."

        "review": "Having recently transitioned to the AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, I must say it's a beast regarding raw performance. Sporting 16 cores and 32 threads is a testament to AMD's relentless pursuit of CPU dominance.\n\nThe CPU, in its stock state, without any overclocking, was unfortunately a bit too hot to handle with a standard cooler. This was evident as I experienced frequent blue screens of death (BSOD) in Windows, and temperatures soared to an alarming 90°C. High temperatures could harm the processor in the long run and hamper its performance.\n\nHowever, the game changed entirely once I paired it with the Be Quiet! BK022 Dark Rock Pro 4. Not only does the cooler live up to its name by operating silently, but it also ensures that the CPU remains cool even under heavy load. After the upgrade, I observed a maximum temperature of 70°C with all cores being utilized. This is a commendable feat, given the power and potential of the 5950X.\n\nWhen it comes to actual performance, calling the 5950X a 'monster' might be an understatement. With its 16 cores, I've been able to:\n\nVideo Editing: Handling 4K footage has been a breeze. Timeline scrubbing is smooth, and rendering times have been considerably reduced.\nPhoto Editing: High-resolution images, multi-layered edits, and batch processing are no match for this processor. Programs like Photoshop run seamlessly.\nVideo Encoding: Even in demanding formats, Transcoding videos is high-speed. The 5950X reduces the time taken for tasks that once felt painfully long.\nGaming: Playing modern AAA titles at ultra settings has never felt smoother. Paired with a capable GPU, the 5950X ensures no CPU-related bottlenecks.\nSimulations & Rendering: Whether it's 3D modelling, animation rendering, or running complex simulations, the sheer power of the 5950X ensures tasks are completed in record time.\nThe performance is further accentuated by the 64GB RAM on my X570 motherboard, ensuring that multitasking is effortless and there's no memory shortage, even for the most memory-intensive applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the AMD Ryzen 9 5950X is an absolute powerhouse designed for enthusiasts and professionals who demand the best. However, to truly unlock its potential, it's crucial to pair it with a high-quality cooler like the Be Quiet! BK022 Dark Rock Pro 4. This combo ensures that you get the raw power of the 5950X without the heat-related issues. Look no further if you're in the market for a top-tier CPU setup."

The only downside to this chip is the cost, but that said, it's totally worth stretching to if possible as it'll be quite some time before another upgrade is needed and the performance it delivers is simply lovely. Even the intensive apps I use are smooth as butter and it provides the processing power to support the latest games. A powerful CPU like this will easily provide the speed to support the latest games and help the latest graphics cards reach their potential. Pairing a 4 series RTX GPU for example, with an older/slower processor, will cause bottlenecks, limiting the potential of both. With a 5950X, that simply isn't an issue, it's fantastic.\n\nSo yeah, pricey, but you get an awful lot for the money. I love this chip."

Main reason i have not yet attempted to OC this chip is because alot source said even the platform for this chip recommends not to OC the Chip, due to damaging the chip faster but dont they all say the same thing for every chip.. but OC at ur own Risk I guess but its a 10/10 for me and if u install this chip an you get a encrypted key error to Press y or N, for your bios Keys Press Y an your good to go.. i overthink the process thinking i was going to completely brake my pc. but either or answer is correct and still boots but the N answer just reboots u right back to the black screen asking u the same answer. the right answer ended up Being the \"Y\" botton so go ahead and press that for me and enjoy your CPU <3."

        "review": "I upgraded from a 5600 to a 5800x3d and later bought an aftermarket CPU cooler to run lower temps during summer and for higher gaming performance.\n\nThis upgrade was massive for me for gaming as that is my main focus and hobby on my desktop. With the AMD 5000x series drivers for my bios already installed this was plug-and-play for me.\n\nGaming performance hit my target 144hz on my 1440p monitor in most games with reduced settings as framerate is my go-to in fast-paced games like FPS. I do occasionally reduce framerate in single-player games or games that are isometric to reduce gpu/cpu load and get more consistent frame-times when upping graphic settings. I would recommend this in most cases for the majority of gamers but this is still my preference.\n\nPerformance is SMOOTH and I do mean buttery smooth for me. The change in the 1% lows was immediately felt by me, but take this with a grain of salt especially if you are less experienced with high framerates/stutters and not a major PC enthusiast. Most people will game at 1080p on lower refresh rates, but please try to take this CPU to at least 1440p 90-120hz for optimal experience.\n\nCOOLER - I kept my wraith cooler from my older 5600 to start while I researched what cooler I wanted to go with but I did game on this cooler for over a month. The wraith cooler was more than sufficient in most scenarios but due to the summer heat, and more demanding games my CPU temps were going above 80C and causing my room to get hotter and some CPU throttling requiring more tampering with settings and research into curve optimization. Much of my room heat comes from my PC due to it being closed, but it is an older house, a lightly insulated wooden home, with 5 windows, along with a mini-fridge and a bathroom that seems to absorb heat from somewhere. This temp was not ideal for me due to my room often being above 80F and during the heatwaves and AC work done up to 88 or higher in my room.\n\nCOOLER Pt 2 - To reduce my room heat and reduce CPU thermal throttling I purchased an aftermarket CPU cooler with 6 heat pipes. This dramatically reduced my CPU thermal throttling reducing my average temps by 10-20F which also reduced temps on my GPU. The cooler I bought was around 40-50 bucks so if you are interested that is more than enough to cool this CPU for its lifetime.\n\nCurve Optimizer(WARNING!! this may void your warrant) - When using a curve optimizer with this CPU you will see a sizeable increase in performance and thermal temps. You can use a no-update manual optimizer like PBO2 Tuner or research into making it always optimized with bios settings. Idle temps get the most benefit from this and second is when performing at medium-high load in my experience. Idle temps were 5-10F reduced and medium-high load temps were in a similar range and sometimes far better due to increased CPU performance as well.\n\nThis CPU is an incredible value for anyone that is enthusiastic about gaming performance. Be aware that there is a newer generation of x3D cpus but the current dollar-to-dollar value for 7000x3d cpus is not close enough to consider for anyone that does not want a maxed-out expensive system.\n\nOn sale, the 5800x3d CPU is an absolute NO-BRAINER for gaming, but please be aware you need to buy a cooler, and you may need a bios update PRIOR to installing your CPU if you do not already have an AMD 5000 series CPU. If the 7000x3d series goes on sale and you are building an entirely new system, you should be aware of RAM costs and Motherboard costs as well as this can be a dramatic price differential for cheaper system builds if you are not careful."

Hammer!\nWas mich dabei erstaunte: Die neue CPU führt auch auch dann zu mehr FPS, wenn vorher wie nachher beim Gaming gar keine 100% CPU-Auslastung vorlag, wenn man also eher an eine Grafikkartenlimitierung denken würde.\n\nVon der Leistungsaufnahme her ist der Ryzen 7 5800X3D im Desktopbetrieb eher noch sparsamer als die alte CPU vorher, da läuft sie so etwa bei 35 W, das passt.\nIm Gaming-Betrieb unter Last zieht der 8-Kerner dann natürlich etwas mehr, etwa 100 W, damit etwa 30W mehr als die alte CPU, was aber den Kohl dann auch nicht mehr fett macht, wenn nebendran eine RTX 4070 Ti Strom zieht.\n\nDie CPU ist nicht ganz billig, aber ich bin's zufrieden und bereue den Kauf nicht.\nAuf der AM4-Plattform gibt es für den Gaming-Bereich nichts schnelleres (und wird es höchstwahrscheinlich auch nicht mehr geben).\nIch denke allerdings, dass sich sowas (die Grafikkarte auch) nur dann lohnt, wenn man sein System mit höherer Auflösung als Full HD betreiben möchte und wenn man schon ein AM4-Mainboard hat, das man noch eine Weile behalten möchte.\n\nWichtig bei der CPU:\nEine performate CPU-Kühlung verbauen, sonst regelt die CPU ab, wenn sie zu heiß wird!\nBei mir ist ein Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE verbaut, was prima harmoniert.\nIn dieser Kühler-Leistungsklasse sollte man schon arbeiten. Oder eine WaKü verbauen."

However, I ended up not being able to help myself :D\n\nNow I'm not sad that I got it & I'm pretty sure when I upgrade my GPU it shall stand me in good stead but so far I've not gained any performance in any game I play from it. In fact, due to the lower clock speed, possibly lost a few frames in some titles. I suspect the 5600x was to well matched with my current GPU (GPU bottle neck).\n\nI think, if you have a 5600x and a GPU comparable to the 6800xt/3080 or under, you might as well skip the 5800x3D. If your GPU is more powerful though, it's probably a worthy upgrade."

I paired this CPU with my 3060ti and it works great. The only issue that I have encountered with this processor is its very high temperature. The max temperature that this CPU can reach is 90 degrees which is a lot higher than other CPU's. I reached near or around this temperature with a stock AMD fan cooler. Therefore , I had to purchase a AIO cooler in order to bring the temperatures down. This also improved my performance significantly as the processor now runs 40 degrees cooler!"

I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing.\nI'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it."

After seeing the performance and reviewing the specs, it is far more superior than the 7900x, for 200mhz more and double TDP, invest in the 7900 instead. Even though the base clock is at 3.7, it's consistently at 4.4mhz or 5.5mhz when in game."

        "review": "First off, I enjoy building SFF (small form factor) type builds.\n\nThe current generation of CPU's were more power hungry, which resulted in more heat to dissipate. Trying to cool a Ryzen 9 7900X on a CPU cooler rated for max 100W is quite difficult, so therefore you have to go towards cases like the NZXT H1 V2.\n\nThis particular chip allows you to not only have near identical performance to the Ryzen 9 7900X with PBO, but also gives you SFF allowable performance at a lower wattage that still provides you power.\n\nSo far today using this has been great, and I recommend this chip to anyone that wants a newer generation chip without the abismal power draws that have been required as of late.\n\nEdit 1/17:\n\nFrom normal use I have seen no difference between this model and the X model. I had both chips in my NZXT H1 V2, liquid metal as the thermal application, and by far the non X model does much better in this type of SFF build. It still will boost, however if you are like me, work from home, and use this all day long in most cases, you aren't going to want the CPU blasting at full power over the entire work day.\n\nQuick note: temps are much better, my fan curve was not changed and the temperature is a lot more tolerable compared to the X version, so my CPU radiator fan does not spool up as much as it did with the X. I let it hover between 50C-65C for daily use and the fans are quiet, with the X the fan was at half or more RPM constantly to keep it at around this temperature and would sometimes hover in the 70's. So, if you are temperature concious then the non-x version is great.\n\nWith that said I am pleased with the product. I do feel though this model needed to be priced at $399, as we have seen the 7900X is selling at this time around $425 on sale.\n\nAgain, I will reiterate, the allowances in this chip should have been more prevalent in the X version, as I feel like we were kind of ripped off slightly this generation on CPU's and GPU's.\n\nEdit 1/20:\n\nThis will be my final edit. I am boosting to around 5.5 MHz with the wattage anywhere from 60-90W. My temperatures are sustaining on load no more than 68C on a single 140mm AIO in the NZXT H1 V2. This is great, I am maintaining the frequency, but with a much lower power draw.\n\nOne item I would recommend is getting an aftermarket chip mounting plate for this chip, weirdly it did make a difference for this chip, around 1-2C lower than the stock MOBO chip mount. I'm using the following mount: Thermalright ASF-Black AM5 CPU Holder, Corrective Anti-Bending Fixing Frame, AM5 Full-fit Fixed Non-Marking Mounter, AM5 Anti-Bending Contact Frame, CPU Cooler Standard, I am also using the following paste: Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut Thermal Grease - 1 Gram Set + 3 Applicators + Pads - Liquid Metal Thermal Paste for Cooling The CPU, GPU Value Pack.\n\nSo far so good, would recommend, and again this is what the first chip should have been - AMD is trying too much to be intel, sure make your server chips, but we buy AMD for efficiency, not brute power in most cases. Sure, there is threadripper, but most of us are casual users. Regardless, this is the chip we all wanted, it's powerful, efficient, and over-clockable."

It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc.\n\nI will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance.\n\nOverall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing.

That's with the cpu wattage unlocked and raising the pl1 and pl2 settings a bit in the bios and a single intake and single exhaust fan in a mid size case. I learned a long time ago that ambient room temp and fan curves are very important. You want to exhaust as much hot air as you can out of the case as fast as possible. You can mount a skyscraper to your CPU and have 12 case fans, if your room temp is high and you don't set proper fan curves, you'll still run hot. I don't care about cinebench or other benchmarks, most games people play and apps people use on a daily basis will never stress the CPU anywhere near what a benchmark will. If you do a lot of heavy video editing and conversion work and raise your wattage limits way up then yes go for a higher end cooling solution .\n\nEdit: I've since installed an Intel RH1 cooler (the one that comes with the i9) on this chip and it dropped my temps by an average of about 8c. I know I can buy a third party cooler but I don't want a huge cpu cooler in my case and I don't want to play with brackets that may not fit 100% correctly. You can find new RH1 coolers on ebay for pretty cheap."

It can be a little nerve wracking as your removing the cpu mount and installing this one but its worth it. As the AM5 CPU has no pins (the mobo now has the pins), its imperative you are gentle on the placement. Best way I found to install this shield was to place the CPU into the socket, then remove the cpu holder so this way you can't damage the cpu or pins as they are socketed. Installing the shield from that point is easy, just don't overtighten it. Theres a bunch of youtube videos on this process. Definitely recommend reviewing them before attempting this step.\n\nI upgraded from my old Ryzen 5 2600X system with a GTX 960 SSC 4GB card and a 512gb M.2 Gen 2 drive.\n\nNeedless to say this was quite the upgrade from my old system.\nCinebench scores on my 2600X even with a mild overclock was only around 7200.\n\nAfter getting everything configured/setup and Windows 11 Pro installed with all updates and enabling EXPO1 (RAM OC) and enabling SAM in the BIOS I started my benchmarking.\n\nCinebench score with just EXPO1 enabled baseline was 28745. What a jump!\nCPU temp on the multi-core threading with the 360 AIO only went as high as 82c (AMD rates these to run at 95c as normal operating temp so it was well below even that).\nHaven't done any OC'ing other than enabling EXPO1 yet since I really don't need to as the CPU and GPU run everything maxed out.\n\nTested on a few games on max/ultra settings and below are what I got FPS wise:\n\nThe Division 2 (All settings maxed and on DX12) - Avg 125fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolution\nAliens: Fireteam Elite - Avg 160fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolution\nBorderlands 2 (older game I know but love to play it with max settings) - Avg 476fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolution\nForza Horizon 5 - Ultra Settings (max) including Ray Tracing - Avg 155fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolution\nAliens: Colonial Marines (older game) - Avg 190FPS on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolution\nWarframe - Avg 155fps on 3440 x 1440 165hz resolution\n\nPairing this CPU and GPU together worked great and the CPU itself is a beast. It does get hot when it turbo's up into the 5ghz range which is why you need a really good cooler (either AIO or custom loop) to keep the temps in check.\n\nIf you do that, this CPU will be everything you need and then some.\n\nOne thing I always tell people is to take your time, plan out your PC parts you want for what you want the system to do (video editing, gaming, streaming, etc). Don't be afraid to look around for good deals. I scored the AIO Cooler off Newegg for a much cheaper price than Amazon had it and it works beautifully and the LCD screen is just a nice \"geek\" factor to put JPG's or GIF's there.\n\nOnce you have everything, take your time when building it. You may run into an issue here or there which is normal. First boot on AM5 systems is sometimes slow (Memory has to train) and you may see it cycle on/off for up to 1 minute. Mine did this and on the 4th power cycle it posted and I could get into the BIOS and everything showed up correctly.\n\nGood luck enthusiasts and hope this review helped with anyone looking at this CPU for their system!\nIts worth it!"

Maintenant, il faut admettre que pour du jeu et rien d'autre, ce CPU est overkill, je conseille de partir sur un 7800x3D et d'utiliser l'argent économisé pour une meilleur carte graphique par exemple.\n\nPour ce qui est des températures,\nil faut comprendre que c'est tout a fait normal que le processeur atteigne 95°C en charge. IL A ETE PREVU POUR.\n\nje vous invite a faire vos recherches, mais en somme, AMD à designé les CPU Zen 4 pour atteindre leur température maximale de fonctionnement afin de bénéficier de toute la puissance a disposition. D\"ailleurs, vous remarquerez qu'il n'y a pas de throttle, la fréquence boost est maintenue.\n\nIl est toujours possible dans le BIOS d'abaisser cette limite de température, mais cela se fera au détriment des performances, du au fonctionnement même de ces Ryzen\n\nTant que la solution de refroidissement est bonne, le CPU ne \"throttlera\" pas, bien que la température puisse faire peur au premeir abord."

Dark Rock 4 Pro. The system drives dual Dell Ultrasharp 27\" 4K monitors. My goal for this system was easy yet intense multitasking and editing of very high resolution RAW photograph files. I could scarcely be more pleased with the results. The core clocks scale to system demands instantly and running multiple programs and monitor windows is effortless. Yeah, the CPU does run hotter than previous generations AMD 12-core/24-thread CPUs; but compare the thermal qualities to Intel's CPUs in this class! My CPU heatsink, even though running only one of its two included fans, has no problems keeping the CPU under 80C, even over sustained high system loads - and that, without being annoyingly loud. Low system loads typically produce CPU core temperatures of about 45C, with a CPU fan speed of 750RPM. I have no doubt I could drop the core temps under heavy load significantly just by adding the second CPU heatsink fan. My only negative comment here is that from purchase date to order delivery required a little over two weeks. Prime used to faster."

I use it for a mix of coding (mainly in PHPStorm), vector graphics (Figma), music production (Bitwig), and gaming (Starfield, Armored Core 6, Baldurs Gate 3, Dwarf Fortress) and I've never been able to bring it close to 100% utilization even running multiple applications and VM's. Mine actually stays at nice temperatures, I paired it with a Noctua NH-U12s and it's in a Pop Air mini case with an XFX 7900xtx. While gaming it'll hit around 78-82c, doing less intense things it can stay around 48-55c depending on ambient temperature. Given that AMD says it can run all day at 90c with no issues, my temps are excellent. I did disable boost mode and set it to clock at a stable 4.7ghz to ensure stability, it stays flat at that speed with no issues. Worth the money."

I pulled the trigger on this instead of waiting for Threadripper 7000, or for more specific info on Sapphire Rapids because the 7950x offers almost everything I was looking for.\n\nIt would be nice to have 4x or 8x ram channels but I find that ddr5 offers a lot of performance on only 2 channels. It would also be nice to populate all 4 ram slots for a full 128 gb, but I'll maybe upgrade to the next gen CPU in the hopes of a better memory controller that can handle higher speed ram when all 4 slots are populated.\n\nIt would also be nice to have the extra pcie lanes that you get with HEDT/WS platforms, but I was able to find a nice board that does all that I need; and most of what I want. Specifically I wanted at minimum one pcie 5.0 X 16 slot and two pcie 5.0 nvme X 4 lanes direct to the CPU without borrowing lanes from the X16 slot or anywhere else. I found that easy enough. Anyway, the chipset i/o on the x670e boards are pretty nice and for my purposes I don't expect to see much bottle-necking on the devices I connected through the chipset.\n\nOverall this chip, and the overall platform, is solid and will hopefully be upgradeable to the 8000 and 9000 series processors when available for even better performance and memory support (I would have given 5 stars if I could run 4 sticks of ram at 6000 mt/s)"

Often times I can go in Ryzen Master and drop the clock and voltage down and things still run at a satisfying degree. I've used this playing at 1080p-2160p. Top to bottom no issues. Like 2 months later the 7950x3D was on sale for what I bought this for but it is what it is. AM4 lasted a long time. Someday I'll be buying some x3D 16 core from the last AM5 gen CPUs.\n\nIt's great when you have software that lets you choose to encode/simulate on the CPU and set how many cores to use. Give 8c/16th and play games without issue. I've kept up with bios updates so I haven't had issues with the overvolting EXPO stuff that was in the news. I use a Thermaltake Peerless Assassin to cool it and that's been adequate even when playing at stock voltages where it hits those 95 celcius temps. You can undervolt this thing, drop the clocks a bit and the performance difference is negligible.\n\nIf you're a software developer, you'll enjoy the amount of cores for running VMs, docker containers, compiling software, etc. I like photography so enjoy playing with RAW photos in Darktable and mild things in Krita. Going from a 4770k to this was a pretty massive change.\n\nI feel like people buying CPUs seperate probably know what to expect. I was able to run a 4770k for 8 years. I don't want to run this for 8 years but I wouldn't be surprised if the performance in games at 2160p is so minor that I just keep going on with this and occasionally upgrading the graphics card"

Make sure you get the core parking to work correctly by following the steps from AMD, but it's super simple.

I like that it switches between two chiplets one with higher frequency, the other with a higher cache. So you can have your cake and eat it too depending on if you are doing normal productivity type tasks or gaming. The switching between chiplets is done by Xbox game bar and is generally automatic. Nutshell is if Microsoft thinks you are running a game it switches to the X3D cache otherwise it uses the frequency optimized chiplet. You can check by bringing up the game bar with windows-g then looking at settings. The tdp is quite low at 120 watts, so it’s a very easy load for my water cooler, so my cooler is pretty quiet and it’s easy to keep the cpu well below its TJ Max. I also used the bottleneck calculator at the pc builds website, and per their estimation this CPU is well matched up to a Nvidia rtx 4070ti gpu. this was completely fine for my usage."

It is NOT without it's growing pains (which I can say now have settled at least for me).\n\nA lot of YouTubers say get the 7800x3d... if you do need core speed for programs or have games that use core speed this makes alot more sense. I think (my opinion) that once the bios and drivers are more optimized to use the necessary cores that have cache, vs higher clocked cores for performance this will be a amazing buy.\n\nRight now, it's a beast!\n\nI run it on a ASUS ROG STRIX X670E-E... the bios here was an issue... with all 7000 cpus it seems over volting cpu/mem controller could cause damage to the cpu or motherboard. I was lucky... my pc shut off randomly several times and I had to manually reset the psu. It seems my psu was saving my hardware. I was chasing down a possible PSU, RAM and motherboard or cpu issue. I spent weeks troubleshooting to no avail, all the answers I got from everyone was to RMA... I wanted to narrow it down so I didn't have to wait weeks for the turn around of each part.\n\nFinally I saw a new BIOs from ASUS.\n1410 is the newest I am using but both this version and 1303 claim to limit SOC voltage to 1.3 which should mitigate the shutdowns and possible damage.\nI really do love this chip and the X3D really is amazing in gaming. Really removes the lower .01 and 1% frame rates.\nI'm totally happy with the performance and am playing with per core curve optimizer. Now that I have more stability I can play with the chip more.\n\nTemps- from my observation the IO die temps at idle are in the 40C range... so that reads as the package temp... when actually the cores are in the 30s and 20s depending at idle. I also run a custom loop with dual 360 rads with the cpu and gpu in the loop. So I'm happy with the temps.\n\nAll in all a great cpu, if just gaming or want to save some cash can do a 7800x3d, if you can use the higher core speeds of a 7900x3d this cpu is for you."

If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i.

The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200. By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs. This i9-11900K will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100%, and that's right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today."

I paired it with an MSI Suprim X 4070ti, and they destroy 1440p together. However, this is obviously a refresh and NOT a new generation. Performance gains are limited and to get there they raised TDP and thus it runs HOT. I have a 240mm AIO and its.. fine. It's just disappointing that this is how Intel responds to competition. This is a missed opportunity. A very good CPU but with both GPU and AMD CPU's getting leaps in generational performance this was disappointing."

It arrived ahead of schedule, with no damage whatsoever (other items were in the box).\n\nPerformance: I've seen reviews that have the chip anywhere from ~-5% to +3% of the 7700X and, my particular chip runs at -3.3% that of a 7700X (real world testing, aggregate from LTT, J2C, PC Parts Picker and GN). That is at stock; I haven't overclocked it or changed the power limits.\n\nContents: Besides the chip and Ryzen sticker, the non-X R7s come with an AMD cooler (in my case, a Wraith RGB). This is not going to win any performance awards but it is good enough for most daily driver tasks and non-overclocked gaming.\n\nCost: In my case, I was able to pick this up for $435 all in - $55 less than the R7 7700X.\n\nRecommendation: This chip should be an easy choice for anyone looking to build their first AMD rig. The 7700X will offer better performance and better overclocking potential but it runs hotter than the 7700 and uses more power. What I find most people don't talk about is the hidden cost of the 7700X: since it does not come with a cooling solution, the user must provide one - and neither the Stealth nor Wraith coolers will be able to do the job adequately. This means that what was a $40 + tax price hike now becomes closer to $85 + for an air cooler or $100 + for a liquid cooler. (For a 7700X I would recommend a liquid cooler because of the higher temps.)\n\nThe 7700 performs as well as a 7700X but with a lower TDP, lower power requirement, lower price tag and an included cooler. New builders and anyone looking to game while saving a dollar can't go wrong with any chip in the non-X R7 series."

The retail box looked like somebody kicked it along the road for about a mile. This would not have been a problem if the CPU actually worked properly.\n\n2.) The IHS and part of the CPU substrate was caked in thermal paste. I don't know if this was Amazon or the previous owner. Leaving the CPU caked in the thermal paste like this was the first red flag, especially if it's the conductive type (as it just increased the chance of it not working properly). I spent about 25+ minutes carefully cleaning up the thermal paste off the entire CPU, with IPA. It really doesn't take too much time to properly apply the right amount of thermal paste on an IHS.\n\n3.) The IHS was marred like someone put a heatsink on top of it without any thermal paste, repeatedly for many times. I have never seen something like this in 15 years of building my own systems.\n\n4.) Lastly, the processor would not boot, with the motherboard's check LEDs staying on the DRAM (as the assumed fault), using two sticks of RAM in dual channel set-up. After trying only one stick of RAM (single channel), the system would boot repeatedly without any issues. I ended up getting a second set of RAM that is on the QVL with the same result. I also tried all the DIMM slots with single and dual sticks of RAM, with the same results.\n\n5.) After purchasing a brand new AMD Ryzen 7600 from a prolific local retailer, there are no issues (booting or otherwise) and the system is rock solid. No new RAM was needed to be purchased in the first place.\n\nLesson learned: I shall not buy \"Like New\" computer hardware from Amazon, there is poor quality control; buy new or buy local if possible."

Present temp, writing this review, is 25 celsius. Surfing and watching videos on youtube, temps are around 29-35 celsius. Have not tried the Intel supplied cooler.\n\nGranted my gpu is not recent, I have yet to update my gtx 950, encoding video using cpu in handbrake is way faster than when encoding using the gtx 950 nvenc and the resulting file size are quite smaller for the same visual quality.\n\nEncoding pushes the cpu and water cooling fans to 100% and temps climb up to 99 degrees but it all works flawless.\n\nHave yet to game with it, will do when I get a new gpu."

Quizá tenga algo que ver también el programa de edición que no es de los punteros que todo el mundo nombra, pero que es fantástico y hace lo mismo. Llevo mucho tiempo usando el programa Magix de edición, si mi antiguo PC podía, este debía poder mucho más, como así ha sido, ya que el programa en sí no requiere tantos recursos.\n\nDe momento muy contento. Lo tengo con el disipador que todo el mundo odia, (el de origen) que viene junto al procesador.\n\nCuando edite a toda pastilla veré si se calienta o no, de momento no.\n\nSimplemente quiero dar un tiron de oreja a quien corresponda ya que la caja me llegó desprecintada y por criticarlo, Amazón no me ha publicado dos reseñas anteriores al montaje del mismo.\n\nSe me olvidaba, el procesador lo he montado con la placa de sugeción que se vende a parte y asegura el procesador de cuatro tornillos para evitar que se doble.\n\nLo recomiendo al 100% ya que es para disfrutar con esta configuración."

        "review": "Previously I had the AMD 7950x and it was pretty fast, don’t get me wrong. However, this 13900ks is a lot snappier even browsing around in windows 11. Programs launch faster and games are buttery smooth @ 4k ultra details, when paired with an Nvidia 4090. I also love the fact that the ks is a “binned” CPU, which overclocks more easily and typically handles faster DDR5 memory in the range of 7800-8400Mhz depending on how good the memory controller is in your 13900ks sample. Regardless, you will probably be able to hit 7800-8000 at the least. This purchase is actually my 2nd 13900ks and I ended up getting a better binned version this time. With an overal(Asus) SP of 113, P Cores 123, e cores 93, and memory controller was 83. Im currently running a G.Skill 32GB(2x16GB) 7800mhz DDR5 kit with XMP turned on in the BIOS. I have been able to bump it up to a stable 8000mhz by bumping up the Memory Controller voltage to 1.4v and the VDD/VDDQ voltage to 1.5v using the same timings that were on my 7800 XMP kit CL36. With the CPU and a Corsair h170i 420mm AIO with 6 fans in a push pull configuration, I was able to get a stable CPU overclock of 60/60/58/58/58/58/58/58 on the (8) P cores, but I’m pretty sure I can bump the 1-3 core workloads higher. It’s when using a workload that requires all 8 P cores that I run into some stability issues with my current cooling trying to push it past 5.8Ghz using all 8 p cores. I leave my E cores all synced at 4.3Ghz stock to help give me more P core Overclock headroom. Another overclock method that works really well, is easy and stable, is to turn on the Asus AiOverclock. Given that I have used both an MSI and Asus Z790 motherboard, I highly recommend the Asus ROG brand line for a Z790 compatible motherboard for this 13900ks. They update their BIOS version frequently and there quality is typically very good on there products that are produced in higher numbers. The absolute ideal motherboard for Overclocking and using the fastest DDR5 ram would be the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX(2-DIMM) motherboard. If you just can’t get your hands on one maybe go with the (4-DIMM) Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero motherboard. You should be able to reach up to 7600mhz DDR5 on it. Whatever you do don’t settle on a motherboard, because it’s the center of the system and can be upgraded later. I started with an MSI Meg Z790 Ace and wish I had started with an Asus. The MSI ran a lot hotter with the same clock speeds and only supported up to 7200mhz DDR5 using 2x16GB sticks. The motherboard attached in the review photo is the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX, a thermal Grizzly 12/13th gen contact frame to make the cpu more level for the heatsink cooler that goes on top and of course the 13900ks that’s a little dirty from previously applied thermal paste I just wiped off. Sorry for the long winded review, but this has been my favorite CPU that I’ve owned. It’s super fast and you can tinker with it for an easy overclock for fun."

The consensus seems to be that this is limited by the thermal connection inside the CPU case between the actual chip and the upper surface which contacts your cooling block. In other words, the cores can overheat even if your cooling system can maintain the upper surface of the CPU at room temperature. You don't want the cores running hot at 99 C for any length of time, and so you really need to tune the CPU clock speed and the voltages with a motherboard that permits overclock tuning. With a good standard CPU cooler, I found it's possible to run continuously with a 4.7 GHz clock on all 24 cores and keep the core temperatures below 85 C."

This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).\n\nIf you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium. If you also don’t plan to overclock, consider the i7-13700F."

        "review": "UPDATE:\n\nShort version:\n\nNot all multi-threaded workloads are created equal so unless you got a water loop don't even bother with static OC and just run 3970X on Auto with power-limit enforced and don't go anything beyond +200MHz PBO.\n\nLonger version:\n\nA note regarding overclocking. I was able to find a real-world multi-threaded workload that pushes this CPU to the limit and doesn't play well with static overclock because power limit doesn't work with static overclock. Under my static overclock of 4.15GHz at 1.200Vcore synthetic CPU stressing workloads only result in power consumption of 260-270Wpackage but my real workload pushed the power consumption to 330+W when all 64 threads were loaded and CPU utilization was 99ish%. This memory and CPU intensive workload takes hours and actually crashed in the middle until I figured out that it was a thermal problem. The first thing I did was drop clocks to 4.0GHz and kept 1.200Vcore and it still crashed but it took longer to crash. Then I looked with hardware monitoring software and saw power over 300Wpackage. I tried synthetic CPU stressing workloads again for comparison and power draw was several tens of watts lower. I tried to force power limit in BIOS but it doesn't apply for static OC. I went to Auto settings in BIOS and haven't looked back. My 64-thread workload that broke static OC runs at 3.7GHz base on all cores with some cores boosting 3.725-3.750GHz on Auto while synthetic CPU stressing software runs 3.9-4.0GHz on Auto with power limit at 280W on Auto settings. So read the rest of the original review but ignore static OC section for CPU. The RAM OC still applies and boosts performance. I also ended up upgrading to NEMIX dual-rank 4x32GB DDR4-3200 22-22-22-52-1T 1.2V ECC UDIMMs that I recommended in original review that I run at DDR4-3600 1.35V 24-24-24-56-1T because latest version of my workload used 90+GB and caused SSD memory swapping and thrashing. I think I lost around 15-20% bandwidth/latency vs my tightly tuned dual-rank Samsung B-dies but if I were going to double those up from 64GB to 128GB there is no doubt I would have lost some of my tight timings 16-17-16-36-1T anyway (probably to 18-18-18-38 with 8x16GB dual-rank, based on experience) and therefore would have lost bandwidth/latency anyway. I went with better reliability as my run times are long.\n\nORIGINAL:\n\n3970X is basically 2x tightly-coupled 3950Xs in one package from CPU cores configuration perspective but being an EPYC Rome derivative (has a wider IO chiplet) also comes with 4x the PCIe 4.0 lanes of 3950X.\n\nI'm cooling mine using $90 be quiet! 250W TDP Dark Rock Pro 4 CPU air-cooler (a necessary monster in this case) and paired with $400 MSI TRX40 WIFI board and 4x DIMMs of G.SKILL Flare X 16GB (dual-rank) binned Samsung B-die DDR4-3200 14-14-14-34-1T 1.35V RAM for a total of 64GB RAM (expandable to 8x DIMMs if I need 128GB of fast RAM - though will likely need to re-tune memory OC with 2 DIMMs/channel). If you need more than 64-128GB RAM I recommend saving the hassles of memory testing/validation and just going with 32GB DDR4-3200 ECC UDIMMs (not RDIMMs, which are not supported) from NEMIX for up to a maximum of 256GB with 8x DIMMs. One note on Mclk and Uclk is that Uclk (uncore clock - L3 caches and infinity fabric) runs at Mclk (memory clock) speeds up to 1800MHz corresponding to DDR4-3600 so that becomes your memory tuning sweet spot for \"free\" performance gains on these Ryzen CPUs. Oh and don't forget to update your motherboard BIOS to the latest version before optimizing anything as results/stability may vary across different BIOS versions!\n\nPlease note that each CPU sample is a little different and your results may vary but it shouldn't deviated too much from my findings below if you are doing it right. Use my optimizations below as a starting point and you may do a little better or worse depending on your sample and your cooling setup. I played around with OC using both PBO method (+100MHz, +200MHz) and static all-core OC method and settled with a static all-core OC, let me explain why. PBO method gives you slightly higher low-thread boost clocks (maybe 3-4% higher, not more) but at the cost of higher automatic Vcore of 1.4+V at idle and low-thread workloads. The PBO method downside comes when you run all-core workloads and Vcore droops down from 1.4+V to 1.3+V with all-core clocks only peaking to 3.9-4GHz depending on a core and CPU package power consumption shoots up to 330W. You may be able to play with Load Line Compensation (LLC) settings to bring down the all-core workload Vcore droop even lower to lower the package power consumption but in my case I haven't seen cores boost above 4GHz on all-core workloads no matter what I did with PBO and LLC and package power consumption still peaked at 300+W so it must be a thermally-sensed sustained limit. With static OC I was able to find a sweet spot where I wanted it to keep package power consumption under all-core workloads closer to the rated 280W with clocks/Vcore optimizations. I was able to do 44x multiplier (44x 100MHz Bclk) for 4.4GHz@1.300Vcore with level 2 on LLC resulting in 1.300Vcore@330Wpackage on all-core workloads but package temperatures peaked just above 80C. Clearly 250W-rated CPU air-cooler wasn't going to work well for 300+W. I should note that these new CPUs do power management really well to internally clock/power-gate as needed based on resource utilization so there's no problem of drawing too much power at idle with a static OC like in the chips of the past. My final balanced CPU static OC is 41.5x multiplier (41.5x 100MHz Bclk) for 4.15GHz@1.200Vcore with level 2 on LLC resulting in 1.150Vcore@260Wpackage@71Cpackage on all-core workloads. Actually, I was stable at 42x multiplier for 4.2GHz@1.25Vcore which with level 2 LLC resulted in 1.20Vcore@280Wpackage during all-core workloads but I chose to save 20W instead of pushing extra 50MHz.\n\nFor RAM OC I settled on DDR4-3600 with 1:1 Mclk:Uclk with 16-17-16-36-1T at 1.45Vmem. Going above 1800MHz on Uclk (uncore) switched Mclk:Uclk to 2:1 ratio despite BIOS setting explicitly set to 1:1 so I didn't bother further and left Vsoc on Auto. Now for the importance of dual-rank RAM, I also have 8GB (single-rank) G.SKILL DDR4-3200 14-14-14-34-1T RAM kits with binned Samsung B-dies that I was able to run at DDR4-3600 14-16-16-16-36-1T at 1.45Vmem. Note that all listed settings are best-performant OC I was able to squeeze out from each type of RAM kit while passing 4 passes of MemTest86 with SMT on (all-core) and 48-hour uptime servicing both heavy CPU and GPU loads simultaneously without idling (I have 2x Radeon VIIs running at 1375MHz@825mVcore and 801MHz@850mVhbm2 that draw ~125W and a stock ITX SFF RTX 2070 in the case). Well the dual-rank 16GB DIMMs at stated OC settings still outperformed tighter-tuned OCed single-rank 8GB counterparts in aggregate RAM benchmarks by about 3-4GB/s aggregate RAM bandwidth and memory latencies were a toss up within a margin of error. For RAM, as a rule of thumb, with single-rank DDR4 DIMMs (usually 4/8GB DIMMs) you need at least 2 tighter timing stops all the way across the board to even try to match the dual-rank DIMMs in real performance/throughput (i.e. 14-14-14 single-rank vs 16-16-16 dual-rank at the same clocks), let alone surpass it. That's it on OC front. Find the best settings to keep the CPU within your cooling budget (important!) and keep the CPU package temperatures low enough (don't get scared by higher core hotspot temperatures that go to 80+C, look at package temperatures).\n\nA little note on 3980X (48c/96t, surely the SKU is in the works for later) and 3990X (64c/128t). These are not well-balanced chips compared to their EPYC counterparts and start lose linear scaling above 40c/80t workloads in many real-world workloads reliant on RAM bandwidth to keep the CPU cores fed (outside of benchmarks that fit into caches) because EPYC counterparts have 8-channels of memory but these TRX40 parts only get 4-channel memory. You will also need Enterprise version of Windows to correctly detect/utilize beyond 32c/64t and NUMA CPU configurations."

        "review": "The monster has been unleashed and will rip through multitasking or heavily multithreaded programs with the greatest of ease! I've mostly used this CPU for automating routines that would otherwise take much longer on other CPUs with fewer cores. With all 64 hardware threads in use, I'm seeing 3.8 GHz clock speeds though that increases to 4.2 GHz with one thread in use based on default settings. (I know I could push that a little more if I wanted.) Threads past 32 seem to be 1/4 as fast so using all 64 threads versus 32 yields a 25% net speed increase. Still, with all 64 threads in use, what would normally take an hour on a typical quad-core CPU will be done in about 8-9 minutes on this beast!\n\nThe stability has been solid. I've never experienced any slow down issues, crashes, blue screens, or anything. I haven't gotten into overclocking much, but I've been using Ryzen Master to monitor temps and clock speeds and have considered overclocking for some tasks.\n\nIf you're into gaming, this isn't quite the best CPU to get, unless you're wanting to stream your game play as well where the extra cores will allow for faster, higher quality encoding without affecting the game's frame rate.\n\nInstalling the CPU was rather interesting. It comes with a piece attached on the sides that sticks out meant for holding it so that you don't touch the CPU itself at all. You basically just align it with the CPU slide-in opening on the motherboard and gently slide it down then secure it with the included specialty torque screwdriver that will let you know when you get to 13.5 in-lbs of torque as it will click.\n\nDo note that this CPU does not come with a cooler. For as much power as it draws and as much cooling as it'll need, I strongly recommend a liquid cooling setup. An applicable heat sink fan setup is just going to be much too bulky and cause problems with future upgrades.\n\nThe 3970X requires a lot of power. With my system idling, I see that my UPS is reporting about 160-180 watts of power usage (30W from display excluded). With this CPU under full load doing just number crunching with all 64 threads in use, I see it jump to about 400-430W. If you get a single high end video card to go with it, that'll increase still more. You'll definitely want at least a 750W PSU at bare minimum, preferably 850W to 1000W.\n\nThe main weak point, of course, is the price. However, for what this CPU can do and how much processing power it has, it's well worth the cost if you're the type that does heavy multitasking or use heavily multithreaded programs a lot."

AMD would have you believe that ryzen is some groundbreaking performance monster and if you believe the media ryzen left Intel in the dust years ago. If you build as many PCs as I have, and work with both platforms on a daily basis you know that's not quite the case. Ryzen is a great platform to be sure, the 3000 and 5000 series perform great typically, however they are often unstable (even without OC) and glitchy and seem to have way more issues than Intel cpus. I won't go into specifics but I'll put it this way: I've exchanged probably 1 in 3 AMD ryzen 5000 series cpus I've purchased for builds and not a single Intel chip. This chip in particular has always proven a stable and extremely well performing example of Intel maturity and stability. It performs exactly as you'd expect and the \"silicon lottery\" always tends to be in your favor with Intel and particularly with this cpu. Don't get me wrong, ryzen is a huge leap forward for amd, and a great platform for high performance and or gaming, but i-series intel just always seems to have a slight advantage (maybe not in benchmarks, but I'm real day to day usage anyways). I'm not an amd fan boy or an Intel purist, I just want a good product to provide my customers in their builds and this is a great cpu by all metrics."

Rock solid stable in games, I had some hiccups with encoding, but with some tweaking we seem to be done with that!\n\nJust a heads up for future owners, the AVX workload offsets work fine, but you should take note that some games now seem to be picked up as AVX workloads. So your offsets might get applied there too, which is kind of a sad thing. I opted to not use that in the end.\n\nThat being said, you better have some decent cooling if you want to push the 9900k beyond 5.1ghz. Probably a delid with reapplied liquid metal might be necessary. I run 2 x 240mm radiators, and with the water still pretty cold, I can get 75c spikes in temps when the CPU ramps ups on the fly. Heavy workloads (encoding) can keep it around 75c sustained, but I really think that pushing it to 5.2ghz we'd start seeing some mid 80 degree spikes. Which wouldn't make me feel super comfortable of running that clock speed 24/7.\n\nTo each his own though! What a beast overall!"

But if one can fit this processor into their budget, the return on investment will NOT be disappointing.\n\nInstallation was very easy, I decided to go with the stock thermal paste that was pre-installed on the AIO Corsair cooler. See specs below. I was able to assemble my new build which took about 3 hours. The wiring/cabling was NOT a breeze. PC Case was a bit tight but everything did install. Mainly I was overly cautious but Win10 installed in under 15 minutes to a desktop. Fast!!\n\nTemps have been very low, ranging from the low 30s to barely above 50 degrees Celsius even in gaming. I have read comments this proc can sometimes spike hot, but my experience is this build is easily the coolest running PC thus far. I am NOT overclocked as yet, have had the build running for about 2 weeks now. Going to wait on that so can't comment but I know this beast is built for overclock potential. My default clocks on all cores seems to peak at 4700Ghz and I am thus far happy with that for now. Esp. From where I am upgrading previous, a 5 year old mid-range gaming PC.\n\nI have had zero issues and definitely notice my FPS in games is up. The only game I am running now is Black Desert Online, most will likely not have heard of this, a 3 year old game that is brutal demanding on hardware with graphics settings maxed out. My old rig pushed 10 to maybe 32 FPS if lucky. Yes I am using a 4K 27 inch monitor. I do need a better graphics card for 4K, you will also if ever considering moving to 4K. It's NOT an easy move if you don't account for graphics power. I have had about 3 years of laggy stuttery gaming (frequently but not all the time) so if considering 4K gaming, do NOT go with low budget graphics builds. You WILL regret it.\n\nBut my FPS jumped up to 40 to 60 fps. All new components except the Video card and monitor are from my old build.\n\nMultitasking is a breeze, everything noticeably responsive and opens quickly. This Proc won't dissapoint. If you can afford it. After my last build in 2014 where I skimped on the processor (core i5 4790K) due to limited funds, I decided to throw as much as I could into the heart of the system and I am very happy I did!\n\nFractal Design Meshify C White Case\nGigabyte Z390 AORUS PRO WiFi Intel LGA1151/Z390/ATX/2xM.2\nIntel Core i9-9900KF Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked Without Processor Graphics\nXPG GAMMIX 1TB S11 Pro 3D NAND PCIe NVMe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 SSD Ultra-Fast PCIe NVMe Gen3x4 Interface Read/Write up to 3500/3000MB/s\nCORSAIR H115i RGB PLATINUM AIO Liquid CPU Cooler 280mm\nCORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB PRO 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3000MHz C15 LED Desktop MemoryEVGA GeForce GTX 1080 GAMING ACX 3.0, 8GB GDDR5X, LED, Graphics Card\nEVGA SuperNOVA 650 G3, 80 Plus Gold 650W, Fully Modular\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Pro\nLG 27-UD88-W 4K Monitor\nThermaltake Pure Plus 12 RGB TT Premium Edition 120mm Software Enabled Circular 9 Controllable LEDs PWM Case/Radiator Fan - Triple Pack"

It was easy to install and runs smoothly and without any issues.\nOnly gripe with this was either the testing technician or packager had left thermal paste all over the top of the chip, and the corner piece or the microchip plating was missing on the backside, yet it still performed and functioned normally. Just a small defect when shipping that could have been avoided with more care in packaging the product."

        "review": "The CPU worked right out of the box and it was easy to install. I upgraded from an i7-6700K and to be honest, I can't tell much of a difference. The boost speed works once you set it correctly in the motherboard settings, otherwise it will never boost to 4.9GHz. Most of my games are running on high/ultra paired with a GTX 1070. However, I can barely see the difference between this CPU and the i7-6700k. There might be a slight jump in FPS but not really. One minute the game is running at 130, then the next it's down to 90 (at least for one game). In CS:GO the game gets anywhere between 260 lowest and 300 highest, averaging at about 280. The CPU seems to hold up fairly well with After Effects. If you're looking to upgrade your CPU from a 6th gen, I'd say hold off, save your money. You're not going to notice that much of a jump, at least I didn't. The CPU also runs a little hot on idle. The product is nice and definitely worth it, I just wish it was a more noticeable upgrade."

I purchased this as a replacement for my Core i5 8400 CPU. According to the ASUS website this is the maximum size CPU I could install on my Asus Z370-A with the latest BIOS update for the 300 series chipset. With the addition of a new RTX 3080TI and 32gb Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL, this PC now performs great and removed almost all of the CPU bottleneck I had. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 now performs beautifully on ULTRA. A must for anyone not interested in replacing their Asus Intel 300 series motherboard."

I got this on sale for 350$, but if its not on sale and youre in the market for this cpu I would recommend getting a 3700x or a 9900k considering you can get either for around 450$ spending the extra money is probably the right choice as the multi core performance in more cpu bound games is pretty noticeable. Great cpu, but if youre getting close to the 400$ mark better to spend a little more for something better."

        "review": "A good Cpu, and a great choice if you are upgrading on a x370 or z390 motherboard. It does not come with a stock cooler, as the stock cpu cooler is inadequate for the I7\n\nI do NOT reccomend this purely for gaming, because the processor has 8 cores and 8 threads, which is overkill for most games, you would be better off buying an i5-9600kf which has 6 cores while still being overclock-able, it has no integrated graphics but, at a lower price. You can invest thay money into something else, like a better graphics card or more SSD storage. make sure your system's performance is well balanced, won't be ideal to pair this with a GT 610 now...\nThe cpu has a boost clock of 4.90 Ghz, and with some tweaking in the bios power settings you can improve its performance, go watch some YouTube videos on bios setting for this CPU.\n\nI brought it for a wide variety of applications where I required the extra cores, such as: gaming and streaming simultaneously, media creation, and rendering videos. I was able to render a 49 minute video at 1080p, 60fps, 12 Mbits bitrate, vbr 2 pass, under an hour while doing other things!\nYes, it was constantly at 100% usage, but I was very surprised that it never peaked over 68°C, I only used a hyper 212 evo black, no water cooling, just 1 cpu fan.\nMy cpu never hit its maximum tdp of 95 Watts though, so I am still leaving some performance on the table.\nAt idle, my cpu draws about 8-20 Watts running discord, chrome, and a bunch of background applications.\nIt is disappointing Intel disabled hyperthreadding for this cpu, therefore the cores and threads are the same number.\n\nThe Cpu won't be a bottleneck during gameplay, it will be up to the rest of your system to do their part.\nWhile recording and streaming, you can easily do x264 encoding at medium preset in OBS, and still have enough performance for the game.\n\nI upgraded from an I3-8100, it was cheaper than getting ryzen as I would have needed another motherboard.\nBeware that your motherboard may not be able to supply enough power for this processor, if its relatively cheap, and is not reccomended for overclocking, it may damage the capacitors on the motherboard from too much current, be sure to look for reviews on your motherboard first to make an informed decision, its better not to risk destroying your motherboard and or other parts of your computer.\n\nQ: Do I need an unlocked Cpu?\nA: Most likely not! However overclocking is for squeezing out even more performance form the Cpu, so even if you aren't planning to get the best performance in the world, it's good to know that when your Cpu eventually becomes underpowered in the next few years, you can always overclock it a bit more to be able to match newer generations of hardware. But in the short term they do cost more money to buy.\n\nI do not believe making a new system with this cpu is a good Idea, as you won't be future proofing yourself. So either get a newer generation of cpu or just wait for Intel or amd to make a cpu that won't change its socket the next generation.\n\nBut hey, it's YOUR system! Do as you please!"

        "review": "(a) Considering its current price and given that its gaming performance (without power limits) is overall identical to the 11700k (without power limits too) and just 3-4% slower overall than the 5800x I would say this cpu is the best choice for gaming. After overclocking it actually beats or matches the 5800x overall even when compared against a PBOed 5800x. By \"overall\" I mean when comparing these cpus in a large range of games (30+ games) and not just 4-5, (something that some biased reviews do)\n\n(b) Productivity is very good too although in heavy multithreaded applications (e.g. tile-based rendering) it does lose by 10-20% to both the 11700k and the 5800x. That said it reduces the deficit to only 3-15% in an overclocked vs overclocked battle, thanks to its higher overclocking potential.\n\n(c) It runs pretty cool - I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and is also very silent. Even on stock auto motherboard settings (and with power limits removed) I don't get temps above 68-69C even when running Cinebench R23 in a loop and sustaining indefinitely the stock all-core 4.7GHz. Temps reduce further when you manually tune the voltage to a lower value (a practice known as undervolting) or when you apply a better thermal paste or a case with better airflow. You can also undervolt and still overclock. Or overclock more without increasing the voltage above its stock value.\n\n(d) I paired it with a fairly high-end Asus Z490 (Strix-E) board instead of a Z590 one. There is no reason buying a Z590 board for 10th gen cpus as for the same price you typically don't get \"enthusiast\" features (such as postcode, third PCIe x16 slot, PCIe bifurcation, etc). Moreover most of the \"goodies\" of the Z590 boards (e.g. PCIe4, additional M.2 slot, DMI3x8) are only enabled when using an 11th gen cpu. So buying a Z590 for 10th gen is a bit of a waste.\n\n(e) Currently the price of the 11700K +Z590 is around 200 euros higher than that of the 10700K+Z490 combo. If the difference drops to 60-80 euros then I would advise to go for the former instead. But as of now the 10700K+Z490 combo is the wiser choice."

        "review": "Don’t let the 125w TDP fool ya because this chip runs WAY cooler than previous gens. Tested temps using OCCT stress test for about 3 hours, alongside my Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The highest I’ve seen the temp spike up to was 71c. Note that OCCT is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the CPU to the limit. Regular gaming temps will never reach that high. I’ve had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time. The games I played included a mix of intensive AAA titles like CoD Warzone and AC: Odyssey to light eSport ones such as Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege. Highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range. That is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times! My brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading. Note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower TDPs than the 10700k yet still run warmer. The reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the IHS of the cpu and upgraded their Thermal Interface Material. Other then the improvement in the temperature department, I’ve also noticed a big difference in gaming performance. Despite having a 2080 super, my PC used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100+fps at 1080p. CPU intensive games like AC Odyssey often dropped to like 50fps. This is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the CPU side. With this new 10700k, My PC now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144+ FPS on light competitive eSport titles and 100+FPS on demanding CPU intensive AAA titles. Also, note that I am running the CPU at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet. Nonetheless, I am very satisfied with this CPU and I highly recommend it."

        "review": "While a good idea anyway, with many processors now utilizing stock overclocks, you can benefit a performance boost by choosing a better CPU cooler. I went the cheap route, actually, I thought it was middle of the road since the Thermaltake Contac Silent 12 is rated for 150w. I thought I could get away with a $30 cooler since I am not planning on overclocking. That cooler could not even keep up with stock CPU settings. In benchmarks the CPU hit 80-Celsius in seconds and gradually up to 90 where I had it set to throttle. In more practical testing, under basic workloads the temps are more reasonable but the Contac Silent 12 has to ramp up to %100 fan speed frequently to keep that way and it is not quiet at that speed. I know somebody is going to say that's because the default settings on the motherboard are overclocking the CPU beyond Intel's recommended settings. Well, that was one of the first things I checked and that's not the case here. Despite what somebody on YouTube said or didn't say, not all motherboards do that. It is a great processor and complements my workload nicely (no games here). The new cooler is a Reeven Justice, $45 right now. I has the same size 120mm fan however it has six heat pipes instead of four and the tower is about %50 thicker and fins stacked closer together. Temps, while still pretty hot, have come down 8-10 degrees on Cinebench R-20. It still gets up to 80-82 Celsius but instead of hitting 80 right away as it did before, it takes until the render is almost complete and seems to level off there. I feel better about the temps now that It's not riding on the ceiling, especially since all core full load is not a typical workload for me. The fan is much quieter during typical use. I would recommend that cooler for those who are looking for a good compatible cooler."

However, even with liquid cooling (EVGA CLC 360mm All-In-One RGB LED CPU Liquid Cooler, 3x FX12 120mm) it still reaches thermal limits during prime 95 (Mix of both RAM and CPU testing). The ram runs at 4000Mhz. Perhaps the performance will be better in regular games, rather than stress testing. Still, it is a bit disappointing. However, even though it only has 10 cores, it has a 14nm architecture. Bottom line is that it can theoretically reach over 5 Ghz, but if it reaches thermal limits it is throttled."

With a good Cooler, Thermal Paste, and Case with good airflow it runs around 25-27° degrees doing normal stuff like navigating, and 32-38°C playing. Haven't got mayor temperatures playing games but it also depend on what are you playing. For example is not the same playing 2D than 3D or Open-World games. Have been playing shooters, GTA V and 2D platformers. One time I rendered a model on blender and it went to 60°C but it was a one time thing, also I was using the integrated graphics (UHD 630) so the CPU couldn't resist that much. With a decent GPU runs smoothly.\nAnyway... What are you waiting to buy this?\n\nFirst of all, I must clarify that I've bought directly from 'amazon.com' and not any other third party store.\nAt first I was a little worried that the box would come with that square shape and not with the fancy one, but doing some research I realized that after the next generation intel came out, they simplified the 10th generation box so no problem with that, also it's just a box so who really cares.\nBy the way I checked the CPU thoroughly and it doesn't have any details, it's completely new and it came with all its certification, stamps, even its manual and everything well sealed and no fingerprints anywhere.\n\nTo finish, the package was intact and very well protected. I could buy again here. 10 out of 10, four spoons, A+, a regular.. tomato? 🍅 Whatever that means.. VERY NICEU CAESAR-CHAN!!.... I'm sorry, forget that.\n\nFinally, nice product.

FX-8350 and even then, heat vs density was a problem, and that chip would just reset when too hot, which happened to me many times on two different 8350 systems. The reset issue was fixed with the biggest air cooled CPU cooler available and my FX-8350 systems ran smoothly 24/7 under full load. The temperatures were also stable, starting at 30c and slowly ramping up to maybe 50-60c under load.\n\nHoly crap is the 3900x a different beast : it drops its own voltage and clock speeds when it gets too hot, and even with the biggest air cooled CPU cooler available, under load it averages 88c(!), which is only 7 degrees shy of the 95c thermal limit. It is also incredibly spiky, jumping between 45c to 60c in seconds at idle. (Yes my thermal paste is applied correctly and the case has nine fans, five of which are 140mm. I have been building computers for friends and myself for two decades. ). I have noted others have better temps on an air cooled system, but that just speaks to quality variability.\n\nI was going to give it four stars but the cooling problem is systemic, not an inherent design flaw. If they are going to fix it they need to double the size of the CPU die in order to give it enough surface area to get all the heat off quickly enough. Water cooling makes no difference if the heat bottleneck is the topside surface area of the chip.\n\nIf you plan on doing long duration full work loads, which are multiple simultaneous EM simulations in my case, the included stock cooler is entirely inadequate. Even short duration full loads with the stock cooler means sitting next to a cooling system running full blast and a chip so hot, it dials its performance back to keep it from prematurely killing itself.\n\nIt is damn fast and my multiple virtual machines have never been so snappy. I had to reset what I thought was a “safe temperature” for a CPU though. Some irony that this is the most I have ever paid for a processor.\n\n[April 2022] Still going strong - I tend to put it into low power mode which parks half the processors when working and change it back to “balanced” when doing anything more that needs a kick in the pants. It hasn’t hard reset because of heat unlike the previous FX8350."

This baby runs hot so make sure you do some research on how to offset the voltage because this thing sucks a lot of power which heats it up to 70 c on idle, unless you have a beast of a cooler. so after playing around with the offset i managed to keep this bad boy at around 70 c under heavy load and around 29 to 33 c on idle. just a quick tip that i had to figure out, overall it's a great cpu, worth the extra coin."

I used Ryzen Master to lock the volts a bit lower, and got the cores locked at 4250 it runs more stable and steady now. Ran an iray render in CPU mode for hours with no crash, on default it would crash after a while. Hasn't gotten hotter than 80C since I tweaked it, was hitting high 90's before with iray render. This thing was a huge bump in both benchmark score, and in program performance from my 2600x. More than I expected, usually when I upgrade CPU benchmark goes a bit up, but I don't notice any difference other than that."

I have researched this on the web and it does not seem to be motherbord, mouse or even cpu model related as othr AMD cpu's, other mother boards and other mice all seem th exhibit the same issue."

De mano antes de pedir la mercancía me puse en contacto con el vendedor para indicarle que no quería un producto usado, reacondicionado o manipulado, de hecho, antes de abrir la caja hice un video realizándolo para curarme en salud, por suerte vino todo bien precintado y en perfecto estado. (Leí las reseñas de los usuarios y procedí así)\n\nPor una parte, tenemos el procesador Ryzen 3900X con 12 núcleos y 24 Hilos con frecuencia base de 3,8GHz y hasta 4,6GHz con socket AM4 y un TPD de 105w (Ojo que el consumo es bastante inferior, solo llega a ese extremo en renderizado y puntualmente)\n\nLo tengo instalado en una placa base MSI PRESTIGE X570 CREATION con 32GB de RAM DDR4 a 3600MHz (G. Skill Trident Z adecuada para estos Ryzen) con refrigeración líquida NZXT Kraken X42 y su temperatura es de 34-38°C en procesos normales, jugando no pasa de los 50°C y renderizando no pasa de los 65°C (Temperatura ambiente 21°C)\nEn relación con el disipador de serie (Probado pero reemplazado por refrigeración líquida que es más eficiente), es muy chulo, las luces RGB muy llamativas, buenas velocidades de ventilador para no meter mucho ruido (No es muy ruidoso a bajas temperaturas a altas es algo molesto)\n\nEn la parte inferior del disipador de serie en vez de ser plano totalmente tiene 3 ranuras, en principio es para una mejor refrigeración pero que con la pasta térmica no hacen el contacto adecuado que debería y es fácil echar más pasta térmica de la adecuada y terminar con la pasta en sitios que no debería\nExisten termal-pad que te evita estos posibles problemas, pero por algún motivo en mi caso con la refrigeración líquida la temperatura es más alta que con la pasta térmica y eso de que es reutilizable en mi caso no ha sido así, ya que queda inservible (Hablo de 0,5 mm)\n\n*Un factor determinante a la hora de comprar este procesador y no un i9 9900k o i9 10900k han sido las vulnerabilidades que siguen afectando a Intel y que, aunque alguna este parcheada por software o por hardware no me convencía su compra\nRecomiendo este procesador porque es una pasada lo optimizado que va sobre todo para edición de video y para los más gamers para jugar, además su precio es muy bueno ahora\nEso si es muy importante tener un hardware equiparable a nuestro procesador, (Una buena fuente de alimentación es primordial)\n\n* El consumo energético es bajo (Mi PC con todo suele consumir sobre 130-250W), dependiendo la carga de trabajo.\n\n** Mucho cuidado al poner pasta térmica, si pones de más límpialo en el zócalo, no vaya a ser que lo retires y parte de esa pasta pase a los pines.\n\n*** Ahora Ryzen saca la serie 5000, el equiparable al 3900X sería el 5900X, que si leemos las características y mejoras no lo veo una gran mejora, he tenido la opción de comprarlo, ya que socket y mi placa lo admite, pero por 200MHz no compensa. Además, pasa lo mismo con el 3900XT son 100MHz más. El 3900X me parece la mejor opción de compra además las BIOS ya está pulidas.\n\n**** Se supone que este procesador su frecuencia base es de 3,8GHz y llega hasta 4,6GHz, yo usando el modo automático de MSI trabaja todos los núcleos a 4,2GHz, todo esto a una temperatura de 36°C (Sin carga de trabajo), ahora en renderización de video llega a 4,3GHz pero nunca ha superado esos 4,3GHz (A ver si con las nuevas BIOS mejora esto)"

Últimamente con el i7 había ciertas situaciones en las que al ordenador le costaba hacer varias cosas a la vez, incluso el navegador va lento, pero con el 3900x nada se atranca\n\nLo tengo en una placa MSI MAG B550 TOMAHAWK con dos módulos crucial de 16gb, 32gb en total, 3600mhz@cl16. Esta placa viene con el \"PBO\" activado por defecto, cosa que al principio me dio problemas cuando le daba caña al 3900x, es decir, ejecutando ffmpeg codificando solo video, a los 3-5 minutos se reiniciaba, y no por calor, en en la prueba de estrés mprime/prime95 small fft en vez de calentarse lo que hace es bajar el reloj por debajo de los 3800mhz!?, que la opción de overclock de AMD haga underclock... madre mía. Después de probar las diferentes opciones de overclock me decante por OC manual de CCX y lo he conseguido poner a 4275, 4225, 4100, 4100 @1.187v, que creo esta bastante bien, no le doy más caña, porqué con un disipador neptwin v2 y ejecutando mprime small ftt se pone un poco por encima de los 90C, aunque no creo que haya otra prueba que lo estrese tanto, codificando en ffmpeg, libx264, solo video, se pone un poco por encima de los 70C, en reposo queda por debajo de los 40C y haciendo tareas ligeras como mucho sube a 45-50C\nVolviendo a porqué un 3900x y no un 5800x, con las tarjetas gráficas que \"\"hay\"\" en el mercado, el cuello de botella es siempre la tarjeta, exceptuando las tarjetas tope de gama, teniendo en cuenta que ahora mismo adquirir una tarjeta gráfica es imposible, sea tope de gama o no. Me he tenido que conformar con una Radeon R9 Fury que tenia de antes, es imposible comprar una tarjeta gráfica a un preció decente.\nEn general suelo usar la \"potencia del ordenador\" mayormente para reproducir video a x50, con el i7 solo podía hacer x8-x20 como mucho (depende de la resolución y fps del video), es una buena-rápida manera de ver si un video tiene errores mirando los logs del mpv. Y he ido acumulando una gran reserva de videos que están pendientes de re-codificar.\n\nExtras:\nHaciendo streaming con el OBS 1080p@60fps, x264, preset fast, la barra de estado pone que usa 10-20% de la cpu\nOtro de los motivos por los que compre un procesador tan \"potente\" fue porqué hay varios programas que tienen la opción de usar la aceleración por hardware de tarjetas gráficas, pero esta opción suele dar problemas, así que ahora puedo desactivar esta opción ahorrándome cuelgues en navegadores, problemas con los reproductores de video... y todo esto es rendimiento extra para la tarjeta gráfica\nAñadir que he aprovechado para hacer el salto de windows a linux, la placa, procesador y ram han funcionado sin problemas y los drivers de la tarjeta gráfica son fáciles de instalar. En linux los problemas son encontrar alternativas de software y cosas pequeñas que quieres tener como en windows y tienes que adaptarte..."

El Ryzen 9 3900X con sus 12 cores y 24 threats doblado el número de threads, y cada core es unas 5 veces más rápido. Ahora las máquinas virtuales (una mezcla de Linux, Windows Server 2012 y Windows Server 2019) se levantan en 5 segundos. He instalado el Ryzen 9 3900X en una sencilla placa GIGABYTE X570 AORUS Elite porque incluia tarjeta de red Intel (queria evitar que el ESXi no reconociera a las tarjetas Realtek de otras placas). El resto de la configuración es 64GB de memoria no-ECC 3200Mhz, 2 x 2TB Intel SSD 660P Series, 2 x 4TB WD GOLD 7.2K 128MB (WD4002FYYZ), Corsair RM850i,\nGigabyte GeForce GT 710, todo dentro de una caja COOLERMASTER EATX MASTERBOX 5 Black Edition con 4 ventiladores EZDIY-FAB PWM 120 mm. He utilizado el ventilador Wraith Prism de serie que venia con la CPU porque no voy a hacer overclocking.\n\nEl ESXi v6.7u3 se ha instalado sin ningún problema y ha reconocido todo el hardware. Además también tengo habilitadas las funciones para el i/o passthrough devices (por ejemplo, si quiero puedo asignar la tarjeta gráfica a una VM).\n\nYa se que al utilizar un procesador y placa base de gama consumer (no es ni workstation ni server) pierdo funciones como el control remoto iLO/IPMI, o la posibilidad de monitorizar el hardware (temperaturas, ventiladores, etc.) desde el ESXi. Sin embargo, por el coste total (unos 1600€) tengo una bestia de equipo con componentes garantizados para muchos años. Si quiero más fiabilidad puedo simplemente montar un segundo equipo de backup (por ejemplo con un Ryzen 7 3700X para reducir costes) y me sale todo muy barato.\n\nCon los nuevos Ryzen 7 y Ryzen 9 ya no hace falta irse a la gama de procesadores para servidores y pagar una fortuna para tener un servidor potente."

        "review": "Update Aug. 14, 2014 - This processor has been superseded 2x as of this writing and is not something you should be considering at this point - the 4790 and 4790k are in the same lineup position and if found at a good price offer a much better performance/price ratio. In addition, the primary reason for selecting this non-k series chip over the more easily over-clockable k series was the TSX instruction set that provided simplified optimistic execution capabilities for developers. This instruction set is being disabled through microcode updates as it has been found to be unreliable under some very unique circumstances (Intel released a specifications update in August 2014 and details are in erratum HSW136). Very little, if any, consumer software uses this feature and that software will still function (potentially slightly less efficiently).\n\nTSX was important to me as we are familiarizing ourselves with it for application on some projects in which transaction synchronization is critical (complex multi-enterprise applications). The information I have extracted from various press releases indicates that this does impact current and soon to be released Haswell chips (at least through Haswell-E and Xeon EP) and Broadwell Y-series chips. As of this writing, Intel has not confirmed a timetable or chipset family/iteration in which TSX will be enabled and functioning properly. If you do not understand what TSX is than the biggest impact this issue will have on you is the 20 seconds you just wasted reading about it...\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nQuick Review:\n\nWhile the i7-4770 is a solid processor for desktop users seeking power and bang for the buck and not concerned about the highest clock speed, it is not worth the upgrade if you are on a Sandy Bridge or newer CPU. I upgraded from a much older platform and I would have waited for the 2014 Haswell-e/Haswell refresh chips if the capacitors in my old motherboard had hung in a little longer.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Supports Intel's Transaction Synchronization Extensions (TSX): This is not supported by the initial K series Haswell offerings and represents a capability that, as an executive responsible for software development, I would leverage in any effort where I could not justify the investment in fine-grained thread synchronization. I expect that game, CAD and multimedia developers are going to be looking to leverage this. As of this writing, this is the fastest consumer chip that supports it.\n\n+ Good performance relative to current offerings: Stock i7-4770 chips do well on benchmark and real world tests. As of this writing (July 10,2013), cpubenchmark.net reports an average CPU Mark of 10,126. That is higher than any stock chip under 580USD, even beating the 4770k at stock speeds.\n\nCons:\n\n- Surprisingly high retail price at introduction for what it is, I paid 310USD with an Intel box price of 312USD - expect prices to drop as initial fervor dies down and the Haswell line matures.\n\n- Potentially superseded quickly by the i7-4771 (same capabilities with higher speed, possibly driven by improvements in binning with process maturity).\n\n- Surprisingly disappointing performance improvement over previous generations (particularly memory operations).\n\n- Extremely limited overclocking.\n\nNeutral:\n\no Requires an LGA1150 motherboard - you can't reuse your old one if you wanted to, but LGA1150 chipsets natively have greater peripheral support\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIf you are reading this than I expect you either typically build your own PCs, are considering your first build or are considering upgrading an existing LGA1150 PC (assuming you are reading this in 2014 or later). In each of these cases, you are not the typical user so I will not waste time on basics or information that is available elsewhere. I will give you my opinions and the reasoning behind them and hope they will help you making your own informed decision.\n\nI have been building and tweaking PCs since the early 1990's, but I have only done a half dozen builds for personal or family use. For my primary desktop I tend to build 1 tier from the top (enthusiast, high bang for the buck) and keep it for a long time. It takes me about a day to build a machine and get the OS to boot, but it seems like it takes months before I have the applications fully configured. This build replaced a late 2003 Pentium 4 3.2GHz Northwood Socket 478 build. Yep - almost 10 years. And I actually use my machine - Catia, heat transfer simulations, photoshop CS, HDTV video capture and editing, large MS project plans, various SW development environments and the standard Office applications. I do occasionally game, but not a lot of FPSs. The Socket 478 machine performed as needed until late 2012 when the lack of 64bit and being limited to 2 concurrent threads became an issue (I have access to other hardware, so it was never a road block).\n\nWhile the new i7-4770 based machine is faster, I am surprised by how little improved it is in real world applications. The most conservative general application of Moore's law says that the new machine should be able to process about 30 times as much information (double every 2 years over 10 years). Having lived with the new machine for few weeks now I am convinced that it is not that much faster. I have used PassMark's Performance Test to benchmark and maintain my personal machines since 2001 so I can provide some objective comparisons in addition to a thumb in the wind estimate...\n\nUsing Performance Test v5 with the 4770 machine running 8 threads vs. 2 threads on my old 3.2GHz P4\n\nCPU Mark: 7146.7(i7-4770) vs 665.0(P4) - about 10.75 times the CPU Mark of the old machine\n\nWith the 4770 machine running only 2 threads its rating drops to 3343.3 (~5x)\n\nWith regards to the built in 4600 graphics - the P4 at the time of testing was sporting a Radeon HD 3800 AGP 8X...\n\n3D Graphics Mark: 2415.0 vs 2358.8 (almost no change)\n2D Graphics Mark: 260.8 vs 114.3 (2.25x)\n\nThis is a bit of an unfair comparison as a midrange modern dedicated graphics card would likely improve the new machine's performance by an order of magnitude, but it does put Intel's onboard GPU in perspective.\n\nAnd the real disappointment - memory...\n\nMemory Mark: 992.7 vs 564.9 (~1.75x)\n\nThe new machine has much more memory and PerformanceTest 5.0 is 32bit so the new machine has considerable addressing overhead handicapping it, but this really shows how little difference there is between ancient low latency DDR-440 and comparatively high latency modern DDR3-1866.\n\nThere is one category where we see the type of improvement we would hope for after 10 years - storage performance. Disk access has always been a bottle neck for me so the P4 was loaded with two Raptors in a RAID0 configuration for the primary boot and application drive. The 4770 machine has a single SSD. The result:\n\nDisk Mark: 19406.6 vs 418.2 (~46x)\n\nThe overall PassMark rating of the new system in PerformanceTest v5 (running 8 threads) is 6322.9 versus 677.3 or slightly over 9 times the performance of the old P4 machine.\n\nThese numbers back up the way the new machine feels - much faster, but not shockingly so. In fact, shockingly disappointing would be more accurate.\n\nDid I get a bad 4770? Bad motherboard? Bad memory? Should I give up my job as an engineering executive and go back to playing with Legos because I can't even build a PC? To answer that, let's see how the new machine compares against modern machines. Using the current version of Performance Test (v8.0) yields the following results...\n\nPassMark Rating: 3,227\nCPU Mark: 11,114\n2D Graphics: 1,120\n3D Graphics: 559\nMemory Mark: 2,961\nDisk Mark: 4,266\n\nThese numbers are solid. In fact, with the exception of the 3D Graphics, this machine outperforms the other 71 i7-4770 based systems on cpubenchmark.net as of this writing. And the i7-4770 is arguably the fastest stock chip you can get for under 580USD. This makes the lack of progress over the past 10 years even more clear.\n\nMy take is:\n\nUnless you have to have a new desktop now, you really should sit this round out altogether - Intel did. The lack of TSX support on the K-series takes them out of play. I am doubtful of the real world improvements of the Ivy Bridge-e as well. If you have a Sandy Bridge, or a Sandy Bridge-e - in my opinion you built at the right time. We have two 2600K based machines and they will serve in their roles well for many years. My plan for my personal desktop is to take a good look at the Haswell-e chips after the prices stabilize (along with DDR4) - maybe sometime in 2015. If I like what I see, the i7-4770 will be transitioned to our HTPC and I will build a new desktop then. That will give me 2 years with this hardware on my desk - about 1/5 of what I got out of my last desktop build."

This is obviously not an OC version but it runs very cool for me even under long periods of major load (Arma 2, 3dMark, BF3, etc). I average around 55 degree Celsius under long term loads (i.e. 1900X1080 with ultra settings or extreme benchmarking config) with my Noctua CPU heatsink/ fan. Honestly, this rig is every bit as fast (if not slightly fast than my previous 2600K setup running 6870's in Crossfire. I built this system for the purpose of solid performance but without significant heat and I think I managed to achieve that - although running a single graphics cards may have more to do with it. Most stable, quiet, cool, and solid performing bang for the buck yet (and this is my 8th or 9th build)...\n\nSide note - I have become a Gigabyte convert over the last 3 builds (Ivy Bridge and Haswell). The reliability in terms of hardware and OS performance has been superior to my previous Asus builds especially in areas like power management. Not that I had bad experiences with Asus, but there were flaky things that I don't run into with the Gigabyte boards recently. Also the PCH and USB controllers run cooler (but that comparison is only fair for the Ivy Bridge series due to the changes in Haswell chipset architecture).\n\nConfig:\ni7-4770\nCorsair Vengeance Series C70 Arctic White\nGigabyte GTX 770 GDDR5-4GB 2xDVI/HDMI/DP OC WINDFORCE 3X Graphics Card GV-N770OC-4GD\nCrucial Ballistix 16GB (2 x 8GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) BLT2KIT8G3D1608DT1TX0\nIntel 520 Series Solid-State Drive 120 GB SATA 6 Gb/s 2.5-Inch - SSDSC2CW120A310 (Drive Only)\nWestern Digital WD1002FAEX Caviar Black 1 TB SATA III 7200 RPM 64 MB Cache Internal Desktop 3.5\" Hard Drive\nGigabyte Z87 LGA 1150 2 Way SLI HDMI DVI Displayport ATX (GA-Z87X-UD3H)\nNoctua NH-U12S 120x120x25 ( NF-F12 PWM) SSO2-Bearing ( Self-stabilising oil-presure bearing ) CPU Cooler\n2 x Noctua 120mm, Anti-Stall Knobs Design,SSO2 Bearing PWM Case Cooling Fan\nSeaSonic X Series X650 Gold ((SS-650KM Active PFC F3)) 650W ATX12V V2.3/EPS 12V V2.91 SLI Ready CrossFire Ready"

        "review": "I bought this because I didn't think that over-clock capability was worth the $40. As my first build, I want the very best i7 processor that I could buy aghast was non-k. Plus, I like tsx and run virtual machines, so the crippled K version wasn't really going to do me well. Upon using it, it's great. I upgraded from an i5-460m (laptop) to an i7-4770 (desktop build) and I can not describe the difference and speed. I edit videos heavily, and this is such a huge upgrade. I'm also a hardcore gamer and I wanted great performance for under or at 300. This is the best bang for your buck at this range. I've done builds for friends with the AMD FX-8350 and let me tell you, while the 8350 is a great 8 core processor, it's 8 physical cores can't even begin to match the i7's 8 logical cores. (4 logical 4 physical). I ran a minute segment of video more than three times as fast as my i5-460m did. Freezing and choppiness is a thing of the past, and when I want to save power, I can switch off my radeon 7950 and use the 4770 graphics (which are about 20 frames per second away from matching one of the industry's high end graphics cards, the 7950 I might add). Also, turbo boost can overclock to 3.9 ghz which is a nice little 500MHz increase, as long as temps are low. I was going to buy an h100i but I decided to try out the stock cooler to see how it is, and it keeps it very cool, so I'm sticking with it. In benchmarks, the 4770 outdoes the 4770k at stock speeds, even though the k has a 100mhz lead"

All these kids who played xbox then bought a pre-built PC and thought that a 'i7' is better than 'i5' because of a two number difference xD I can run BattleFront II Maxed ULTRA settings, Anti aliasing and the whole nine yards turned on in Nvidia CP, I dont optimize it in GEFORCE Exp either; with the wrong settings it helps sort you out but if you have good settings with good performance itll just weigh you down,I have preferences set to in game for most of the Nvidia CP but theyre high asf, I mean this thing isnt cranked to 100 but DAYUM, it delivers. Mind you this is ALL on HDR10 50\" TELEVISION xD I know. I need a monitor, its coming, btw I get a solid 40-60 frames 30 in ERY intense situations, thats because I need a better monitor lol this thing is 120Hz for TV but its not your standard 165Hz monitor which I require. ANYWAYS. Shes a beaut and barely hits 100% in extreme situations. Like currently my CPU is at 10-15% Usage, GPU is at 15-20%, VRAM at 44% and RAM at 37%. With like 7 programs running. In game My GPU maxes 100%, thats normal guys lol, VRAM will be like 60-70%, TOPS 90-95% on insane games, with the RAM constantly following at arounf 7-15% behind it, And the CPU maintains a strong 80% with Quality and performance High and well, even at 100% on Space Engineers it handles fine, Frames and all, but i dont wanna push her, thats why I disable any extreme performance overrides in my motherboards software manager. Sony Vegas btw this thing handles flawlessly for editing with right settings. just disable Extreme performance from your Motherboards Software manager and turn it to a balance setting, and also shes VERY quiet with right cooling installed, I myself have a water cooler and 14 fans for internal. CONCLUSION: BUDGET, BUILT, BOLD, BEAUTIFUL. No this is not a Mascara commercial this thing is just good."

I used to use Asus all my life (beginning from core 2 duo processors or even Pentium 4).\nSo, the system was ready to go and it was fast, quiet desktop with Fractal Design R4 case and Noctua D15 cooler( with two fans).\nNo more fans than stock ones in my FD case (one for intake and other for outtake at the back).\nI OCed the system to 48Ghz at 1.26 Adaptive voltage or so (I don't remember exact number of voltage but 100% it was lower than 1.3v).\nAnd I created my computer and I looked at it and it was nice :)\n\nBut then I started to view benchmarks, assessments in syntetic tests and noticed that 9700k is faster than 8700k in most cases. It faster than 7820x in most scenarios but....\nBut 9900k is much more faster in rendering, photo editing and streaming tasks. In two words, in those cases where multithreading takes place and all real cores + virtual cores are used at their 100%.\nAnd ...

To which extent - this is the question.\nWill I surrender or try?\nAm I a risky person?\nNo I am not.\nBut... how hard I wanted to try... I could not control myself and I did it.\n\nSo...

I used discreet graphics card (XFX RX 580), I did not use internal graphics. Maybe usage of internal graphics may cost you more in temperatures and wattage.\n\nWhen I first started my computer I entered BIOS and\nI STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO IT: TURN MCE OFF IN BIOS.\nThis is the most important thing you can do.\nWhy?\nMain reason to do so is the MCE puts very high default voltage to the processor.\nThen increase power limits:\n\nLong Duration Package Limit is 190W\nPackage power time window is 2sec\nShort duration power limit is 220W.\n\nCurrent CPU capability is 170%\nCPU SVID support Enabled\n\nVRM Spread Spectrum Disabled\nSVID Behaviour Typical Scenario\n\nIA AC and IA DC load lines to 0.01\nCPU Load Line Level 5 (not sure this parameter works at all due to set previous ones to 0.01)\nVT-D enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)\nVMX enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)\nNow, I played a lot with core multipliers and voltages and came to these results:\nCore mutlipliers for 2 first cores: 50\nCore mutlipliers for another 6 cores: 49\nCache multiplier 43\nAVX offset: 3 (I strongly recommend to put this offset)\nVoltage: Adaptive (I know, many reviewers and commenters do not like adaptive voltage. I like it.)\nAdaptive Additional Turbo voltage 1.25\nAdaptive Offset : +0.015\n\nFor memory I set XMP I profile (3200Ghz 16-18-18-36 2T)\n\nFor your system these voltages may not be appropriate, all depends on your die's quality.\nAlso I played a lot with offset for the Adaptive voltage (see below why).\n\nNow the system is ready to go.\nMy ambient temperature in room is 22 C\nTests I used:\n1/ Prime95 Small FFT non-AVX version.\n30 minutes with 4900 on all cores.\nCPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 75 C\nTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 177W (max)\n\n2/ Prime 95 Small FFT AVX version\n30 minutes with 4600 on all cores\nCPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 76 C\nTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 179W (max, though I notices some peaks to 181W rarely)\n\nWhere I played the most was the Prime95 with AVX enabled.\nThe issue was that some cores stopped intermittenly (one or two cores) during full load (in 5 minutes or even in 15 minutes).\nThe community recommend to increase VCore a bit in that case.\nIn the continuous process of playing with all this I came the above voltages.\n\nI suppose I could put 50 to all cores and 3 AVX offset and get 80 C temperatures but I did not do it as I don't like so high temps.\n\nOf course, with regular apps and even other stress testing apps like Cinebench, Realbench, Aida or Asus Exteme Tuning Utility you do not get those temps at all.\nI double you can actually load the processor that hard (16 threads with 100% load) with any regular app. Let alone for so continuous time...\n\nAlso I tuned my fan curves so they spin at 90% when CPU temp goes upper than 65 C.\nSo at high load even so super silent case like Fractal Design R4 is loud like a rocket.\n\nThis all makes me conclude that all those talks about loose VRMs on these boards are no more than just talks.\nOf course I don't know for how long the processor + MB will last in my scenarios but it works nice so far (3 weeks) with regular loads: compilation, photo editing, virtual machines etc.\n\nFrom this point I can compare my old computer (Asus X99-E + 5820k overclocked to 4200Ghz) to this new one.\nForgot to mention, by the way, I use NVME Samsung 960 EVO 500Gb drive in my system.\nOn older one I used Samsung 860 EVO 500Gb.\n\nEverything runs faster, and works blaze faster on newer PC.\nThe system with 5820k even OCed at 4200 was somewhat meditative at moments (maybe old Win7 OS with bunch of trash slowed it down or what).\nI will make additions to the review when I will have something to add."

        "review": "Nel corso di questi tre anni, l'i5-9600K ha vissuto momenti di intensa attività e giornate di relativa tranquillità. Dal fotoritocco al rendering, passando per sessioni di gaming ad alta definizione, non c'è stato un solo momento in cui abbia sentito il bisogno di un processore più potente. Il vero test, però, è arrivato quando ho iniziato a lavorare da casa, dovendo gestire diverse applicazioni contemporaneamente. Nonostante il carico di lavoro, l'i5-9600K ha dimostrato di essere all'altezza della situazione, permettendomi di svolgere le mie attività senza alcun rallentamento.\n\nPunti di Forza:\nIl principale punto di forza di questo processore è senza dubbio la sua performance. L'i5-9600K è infatti un vero e proprio campione di velocità e multitasking, capace di gestire anche i carichi di lavoro più pesanti senza alcun problema. Inoltre, nonostante le elevate prestazioni, il calore generato rimane sempre nei limiti della norma, un dettaglio non da poco se consideriamo che un'eccessiva temperatura può ridurre la vita del processore e danneggiare altri componenti del PC.\n\nPunti di Debolezza:\nNonostante l'i5-9600K sia un ottimo processore, non è esente da difetti. Il primo è legato al costo: se da un lato la qualità e le prestazioni sono indubbie, dall'altro il prezzo potrebbe risultare proibitivo per chi sta assemblando un PC con un budget limitato. Un altro aspetto da considerare è l'assenza di un dissipatore nella confezione, elemento che dovrà quindi essere acquistato separatamente. Infine, per sfruttare al meglio le capacità di overclocking dell'i5-9600K, sarà necessario disporre di una scheda madre e di un sistema di raffreddamento adeguati.\n\nConclusioni:\nNonostante alcune piccole pecche, l'i5-9600K è un processore che consiglierei senza esitazioni. Che siate gamer, professionisti o semplici appassionati di informatica, con questo prodotto avrete a disposizione un componente capace di fare la differenza. A tre anni dal mio acquisto, posso affermare di essere pienamente soddisfatto della mia scelta e di non aver mai avuto motivi per pentirmi."

It was my last build somewhere between 10 - 15 years ago and did a great job for what I needed, but it was time to upgrade. My love for the Gigabyte motherboard was hard to disregard during my new choices, because it worked well with Linux Mint (15 through 19) and my latest research indicated that they are still some of the most compatible boards. Anyway, I had to toss that in there, because I'm not sure if this CPU just happened to be a good combination with my new board or is just good in general. I decided on this CPU, because I read it was decent with graphics all on its own and my hope was that it would serve my purposes as such. I am not disappointed. All of the lag is gone! I can go in places I simply could not venture without nightmarish lag before - at 58 - 61 FPS without overclocking. This means I don't have to plug anymore devices into my machine and additional cooling gear to keep it all cool. I am quite happy. I haven't tried any Vulkan API related stuff yet, but I'm hoping it will handle it."

Given that the other AMD ones were at least twice the cost, I got this one specifically cause I game and have an RTX 3070. For the cost of 500$ I got a motherboard and CPU to upgrade from my old 6700k. That's still less than JUST the AMD CPU's in the same category. This works well for gaming and for video editing even. Theres a lot of hype around AMD, and yes, they are better. But probably not better enough to warrant spending 3x the cost in my opinion. You still get 8 cores, 16 threads and it's cheap for an i7. If you're going for budget, grab one of these, you won't be disappointed"

Was not disappointed.\n\nOne of the best things about this CPU is how much you can overclock it, so make sure you buy a motherboard like the ASUS z490 that supports overclocking to unlock the full potential of this CPU. It does not come with a cooler or fan but, let's be honest, you should always buy a separate one anyways.\n\nAfter using this CPU for around 5 months now I can safely say it's a great product."

Les performances monocœurs sont bonnes et la capacité multithread permet de gérer efficacement les charges de travail plus lourdes. J'ai remarqué une amélioration significative par rapport à mon ancien processeur, ce qui se traduit par une expérience plus fluide et réactive.\n\nCependant, je dois souligner que le prix de ce processeur est un peu élevé pour l'année 2023. Avec l'évolution rapide de la technologie, il est possible de trouver des processeurs offrant des performances similaires à un prix inférieur. Si vous êtes à la recherche d'un processeur économique, il peut être judicieux de considérer d'autres options sur le marché.\n\nDe plus, il est important de noter que ce processeur est basé sur l'architecture Alder Lake, qui est relativement nouvelle. Cela signifie qu'il peut y avoir des problèmes de compatibilité ou des ajustements nécessaires pour certains logiciels ou jeux plus anciens. Assurez-vous de vérifier la compatibilité avec votre configuration avant l'achat.\n\nEn conclusion, le processeur Intel Core i5-13500 offre des performances satisfaisantes pour les tâches quotidiennes et les jeux.

I worked around this by changing the cooler profile in the MSI bios from \"liquid\" to either \"tower air\" or \"box\". \"Box\" profile changes the automatic PL1 and PL2 settings to run as the i9-13900 non-K spec limits. For a little overclocking performance, I set \"tower air cooling\" mode in the bios and experimented with slightly lower PL1 and PL2 settings as well as lowering the throttle limit from 100 to 95 degrees.

It was my last build somewhere between 10 - 15 years ago and did a great job for what I needed, but it was time to upgrade. My love for the Gigabyte motherboard was hard to disregard during my new choices, because it worked well with Linux Mint (15 through 19) and my latest research indicated that they are still some of the most compatible boards. Anyway, I had to toss that in there, because I'm not sure if this CPU just happened to be a good combination with my new board or is just good in general. I decided on this CPU, because I read it was decent with graphics all on its own and my hope was that it would serve my purposes as such. I am not disappointed. All of the lag is gone! I can go in places I simply could not venture without nightmarish lag before - at 58 - 61 FPS without overclocking. This means I don't have to plug anymore devices into my machine and additional cooling gear to keep it all cool. I am quite happy. I haven't tried any Vulkan API related stuff yet, but I'm hoping it will handle it."

Given that the other AMD ones were at least twice the cost, I got this one specifically cause I game and have an RTX 3070. For the cost of 500$ I got a motherboard and CPU to upgrade from my old 6700k. That's still less than JUST the AMD CPU's in the same category. This works well for gaming and for video editing even. Theres a lot of hype around AMD, and yes, they are better. But probably not better enough to warrant spending 3x the cost in my opinion. You still get 8 cores, 16 threads and it's cheap for an i7. If you're going for budget, grab one of these, you won't be disappointed"

Was not disappointed.\n\nOne of the best things about this CPU is how much you can overclock it, so make sure you buy a motherboard like the ASUS z490 that supports overclocking to unlock the full potential of this CPU. It does not come with a cooler or fan but, let's be honest, you should always buy a separate one anyways.\n\nAfter using this CPU for around 5 months now I can safely say it's a great product."

The performance uplift is night and day between the two, and this would make a fine chip for any new gaming PC you might put together today. Please note that the F variant does not have integrated graphics, but if you already have a GPU then this won't matter for you. This is only 6 cores, 12 threads as well. Being an 11th generation chip from Intel, there's no performance vs. efficiency core debate here, 6 cores is what you get.\n\nOne word of caution is that as I write this review this CPU is currently listed for $199, which is about the most I'd recommend paying for this CPU. The $150 price I paid was fantastic of course, but it's not something I would rely on getting again even with Black Friday/Cyber Monday coming soon. A newer i5-12400 will offer similar levels of performance for roughly the same or potentially less money, though that isn't overclockable. A 12600K would blow this out of the water, but you're looking at a far more expensive CPU. The Ryzen 5600 or 5600X are also great foils for this CPU, especially if they can be had for a cheaper price. The AMD chips also have the advantage of cheaper motherboards for that generation compared to the Intel chips at the moment.\n\nEnd of the day, if you can get this for a good price, go for it, but this wasn't the absolute greatest even for its time, and newer chips can sometimes be had for a better price."

In game My GPU maxes 100%, thats normal guys lol, VRAM will be like 60-70%, TOPS 90-95% on insane games, with the RAM constantly following at arounf 7-15% behind it, And the CPU maintains a strong 80% with Quality and performance High and well, even at 100% on Space Engineers it handles fine, Frames and all, but i dont wanna push her, thats why I disable any extreme performance overrides in my motherboards software manager. Sony Vegas btw this thing handles flawlessly for editing with right settings. just disable Extreme performance from your Motherboards Software manager and turn it to a balance setting, and also shes VERY quiet with right cooling installed, I myself have a water cooler and 14 fans for internal.

        "review": "At first I ordered the 9700k and Asus Z390 Prime-A motherboard.\nYou may ask Why ASUS board why not Gigabyte etc? I used to use Asus all my life (beginning from core 2 duo processors or even Pentium 4).\nSo, the system was ready to go and it was fast, quiet desktop with Fractal Design R4 case and Noctua D15 cooler( with two fans).\nNo more fans than stock ones in my FD case (one for intake and other for outtake at the back).\nI OCed the system to 48Ghz at 1.26 Adaptive voltage or so (I don't remember exact number of voltage but 100% it was lower than 1.3v).\nAnd I created my computer and I looked at it and it was nice :)\n\nBut then I started to view benchmarks, assessments in syntetic tests and noticed that 9700k is faster than 8700k in most cases. It faster than 7820x in most scenarios but....\nBut 9900k is much more faster in rendering, photo editing and streaming tasks. In two words, in those cases where multithreading takes place and all real cores + virtual cores are used at their 100%.\nAnd ... I made a decision to purchase 9900k.\nIt's a costly investment but I thought I would sell my current X99 5820k computer + sell 9700k processor.\nIt's as good as done.\nMy 9900k was in my hands and....\nAnd only then I discovered from various reviews about bad VRMs out there for medium line ASUS Z390 boards.\nI was frustrated.\nHow come?\nWhy ASUS did so?\n\nShould I buy new motherboard now?\nMy Z390 Prime-A is a medium line MB (in one line with Strix and maybe a little worse than Z390 Maximus Hero).\nI started to research and came to conclusion (having tons of sources in the net, including video reviews + comments to them, articles, reviews from community etc etc) that my ASUS Z390 Prime-A will be suffice for 9900k with moderate OC. To which extent - this is the question.\nWill I surrender or try?\nAm I a risky person?\nNo I am not.\nBut... how hard I wanted to try... I could not control myself and I did it.\n\nSo... ASUS z390 Prime-A + 9900k + 32Gb 4x8 Corsair Vengence + Noctua D15 + PSU Corsair 650X + two more 140mm fans for my case (one for upper outtake and one additional for front intake)\nThermal paste I applied to the processor is Arctic MX2\n\nAlso, I must specifically note for people who will use the config. I used discreet graphics card (XFX RX 580), I did not use internal graphics. Maybe usage of internal graphics may cost you more in temperatures and wattage.\n\nWhen I first started my computer I entered BIOS and\nI STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO IT: TURN MCE OFF IN BIOS.\nThis is the most important thing you can do.\nWhy?\nMain reason to do so is the MCE puts very high default voltage to the processor.\nThen increase power limits:\n\nLong Duration Package Limit is 190W\nPackage power time window is 2sec\nShort duration power limit is 220W.\n\nCurrent CPU capability is 170%\nCPU SVID support Enabled\n\nVRM Spread Spectrum Disabled\nSVID Behaviour Typical Scenario\n\nIA AC and IA DC load lines to 0.01\nCPU Load Line Level 5 (not sure this parameter works at all due to set previous ones to 0.01)\nVT-D enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)\nVMX enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)\nNow, I played a lot with core multipliers and voltages and came to these results:\nCore mutlipliers for 2 first cores: 50\nCore mutlipliers for another 6 cores: 49\nCache multiplier 43\nAVX offset: 3 (I strongly recommend to put this offset)\nVoltage: Adaptive (I know, many reviewers and commenters do not like adaptive voltage. I like it.)\nAdaptive Additional Turbo voltage 1.25\nAdaptive Offset : +0.015\n\nFor memory I set XMP I profile (3200Ghz 16-18-18-36 2T)\n\nFor your system these voltages may not be appropriate, all depends on your die's quality.\nAlso I played a lot with offset for the Adaptive voltage (see below why).\n\nNow the system is ready to go.\nMy ambient temperature in room is 22 C\nTests I used:\n1/ Prime95 Small FFT non-AVX version.\n30 minutes with 4900 on all cores.\nCPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 75 C\nTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 177W (max)\n\n2/ Prime 95 Small FFT AVX version\n30 minutes with 4600 on all cores\nCPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 76 C\nTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 179W (max, though I notices some peaks to 181W rarely)\n\nWhere I played the most was the Prime95 with AVX enabled.\nThe issue was that some cores stopped intermittenly (one or two cores) during full load (in 5 minutes or even in 15 minutes).\nThe community recommend to increase VCore a bit in that case.\nIn the continuous process of playing with all this I came the above voltages.\n\nI suppose I could put 50 to all cores and 3 AVX offset and get 80 C temperatures but I did not do it as I don't like so high temps.\n\nOf course, with regular apps and even other stress testing apps like Cinebench, Realbench, Aida or Asus Exteme Tuning Utility you do not get those temps at all.\nI double you can actually load the processor that hard (16 threads with 100% load) with any regular app. Let alone for so continuous time...\n\nAlso I tuned my fan curves so they spin at 90% when CPU temp goes upper than 65 C.\nSo at high load even so super silent case like Fractal Design R4 is loud like a rocket.\n\nThis all makes me conclude that all those talks about loose VRMs on these boards are no more than just talks.\nOf course I don't know for how long the processor + MB will last in my scenarios but it works nice so far (3 weeks) with regular loads: compilation, photo editing, virtual machines etc.\n\nFrom this point I can compare my old computer (Asus X99-E + 5820k overclocked to 4200Ghz) to this new one.\nForgot to mention, by the way, I use NVME Samsung 960 EVO 500Gb drive in my system.\nOn older one I used Samsung 860 EVO 500Gb.\n\nEverything runs faster, and works blaze faster on newer PC.\nThe system with 5820k even OCed at 4200 was somewhat meditative at moments (maybe old Win7 OS with bunch of trash slowed it down or what).\nI will make additions to the review when I will have something to add."

        "review": "Nel corso di questi tre anni, l'i5-9600K ha vissuto momenti di intensa attività e giornate di relativa tranquillità. Dal fotoritocco al rendering, passando per sessioni di gaming ad alta definizione, non c'è stato un solo momento in cui abbia sentito il bisogno di un processore più potente. Il vero test, però, è arrivato quando ho iniziato a lavorare da casa, dovendo gestire diverse applicazioni contemporaneamente. Nonostante il carico di lavoro, l'i5-9600K ha dimostrato di essere all'altezza della situazione, permettendomi di svolgere le mie attività senza alcun rallentamento.\n\nPunti di Forza:\nIl principale punto di forza di questo processore è senza dubbio la sua performance. L'i5-9600K è infatti un vero e proprio campione di velocità e multitasking, capace di gestire anche i carichi di lavoro più pesanti senza alcun problema. Inoltre, nonostante le elevate prestazioni, il calore generato rimane sempre nei limiti della norma, un dettaglio non da poco se consideriamo che un'eccessiva temperatura può ridurre la vita del processore e danneggiare altri componenti del PC.\n\nPunti di Debolezza:\nNonostante l'i5-9600K sia un ottimo processore, non è esente da difetti. Il primo è legato al costo: se da un lato la qualità e le prestazioni sono indubbie, dall'altro il prezzo potrebbe risultare proibitivo per chi sta assemblando un PC con un budget limitato. Un altro aspetto da considerare è l'assenza di un dissipatore nella confezione, elemento che dovrà quindi essere acquistato separatamente. Infine, per sfruttare al meglio le capacità di overclocking dell'i5-9600K, sarà necessario disporre di una scheda madre e di un sistema di raffreddamento adeguati.\n\nConclusioni:\nNonostante alcune piccole pecche, l'i5-9600K è un processore che consiglierei senza esitazioni. Che siate gamer, professionisti o semplici appassionati di informatica, con questo prodotto avrete a disposizione un componente capace di fare la differenza. A tre anni dal mio acquisto, posso affermare di essere pienamente soddisfatto della mia scelta e di non aver mai avuto motivi per pentirmi."

The card is very quiet-- hardly noticeable-- and the Freeze Tech technology shuts the fans off when it's not doing heavy processing.

        "review": "This card stays exceptionally quiet and cool under load. Through 6 hour marathon gaming sessions w/ 100% GPU usage, it's never gotten over 70 degrees and the fans have been near inaudible! The shroud has been redesigned by XFX as I understand it since the 6000 series (RDNA2) and it quite frankly does an AMAZING job cooling a power hungry card that tops out near 400 watts under full load; it's arguably the quietest card I've ever had - which is saying something considering its power usage.\n\nI won't get into an Nvidia vs AMD 'd' measuring contest - but suffice it to say I have ZERO regrets buying this card, a 4080 equivalent in rasterization, for hundreds less. Attached is a screenshot after a marathon gaming session at high refresh rate 4k - cool as a cucumber!\n\nIt's slick as hell to look at too.\n\nBe aware you need 3 x 8 pin power cables as this draws more power than the base 7900xtx model. Don't use an 8 pin daisy chain, use 3 separate cables: Each 8 pin GPU cable is rated for 150 watts, and it pulls 75 watts from the PCI slot. If you use an 8 pin to 2 x 8 pin, that's 375 watts max. The card can boost up to 400 watts, and long term, you don't want a connector to melt like many of the new 4080 / 4090 12-pin cables have been doing; will they? probably not - but I wouldn't take the chance on a card of this value.\n\nIs it pricey? Yes. Should cards cost more than $1000? No. Having said that, if you're looking for a top tier card, stop looking. This is what you want."

        "review": "As the title says. This card is a beast in every which way possible. I upgraded from the EVGA [RIP :< ] NVIDIA 1080Ti, which lasted me a good five years and was still pretty competent in running modern games, but was definitely starting to show its age with a 4K monitor and today's (poorly optimized) games. I decided to go AMD this time around, as the price/dollar ratio with AMD right now seems far better... especially with the 4080 costing on average $300 more, and the 4090 being off into space at double to above double the cost. That's not really cool when this card trades blows with NVIDIA's flagships in raster performance, and the focus of RTX/Radeon is for gaming, not for AI/Compute work. Not that AMD can't do those to be clear... ROCm is a thing, but just needs more developer support for it, and AMD still has some work to do in their drivers to unlock the full potential of these chips.\n\nThe card itself is quite big, as shown in my photos, but it fits snug with my system configuration, the color scheme matches my system quite nicely, and the anti-sag retention bar is a nice addition to have with the card given its size and weight. Cooling-wise, the card operates at 60C when gaming under full load, with a 75C-80C Hot Spot Temperature, with the fans operating at about 30% duty cycle. The card power draw under full load is approximately 390 Watts.\n\nGaming performance wise, I'm satisfied. Games such as Battlefield 2042 at 4K Native, 100% Render Resolution, Ultra Settings, HDR and Ray Tracing Enabled, push 70-100FPS. BattleBit Remastered does well north of 180FPS. Counter-Strike 2 runs at 170FPS+ at 4K Native, HDR and Max settings. Halo Infinite at 4K Native, HDR, Max settings, pushes approximately 90FPS. Overwatch 2, similar settings, similar frame rates. That's pretty much it. The card performs consistently well, and has the VRAM to handle demanding gaming loads (Halo Infinite for some reason needs 18GB of VRAM?!). I could get higher frame rates with AMD FSR3 or by turning off some settings like Ray Tracing, but, hey... these frames are already a huge upgrade from the 1080Ti, and can only get better in time.\n\nVideo Performance Wise: Compared to NVIDIA, AMD does have a weaker video engine. This was something which worried me at first based on my past experience with AMD GPUs (The Vega 8 in my laptop, and the previous Radeon HD 5770 I used to have which would downclock the VRAM every time video accelerated content was played). However, it has not affected my day to day. 8K60 YouTube is handled and plays back with the AV1 Codec. VP9, H.264, AVC1, and H.265 decoding are similarly capable of smooth playback, and day to day use I notice no difference between the 1080Ti's NVDEC chip and AMD's VCE in terms of performance. Encoding wise, Handbrake was able to transcode VC-1 video (This AMD GPU does NOT support VC-1 Decoding in the Video engines, so some software limitations are at play!) to H.265 10-Bit with exceptional quality at 130+FPS, and did so without impacting the rest of the card's performance. AV1 Encoding performance is similarly quick, and for live streaming, is phenomenal, with a crisp picture produced at 14Mbps to YouTube at 1440p. The video engine seems to multi-task reasonably well, and I have yet to encounter any artificial limits imposed in the driver, unlike NVIDIA which limits encode/decode streams on their consumer GPUs... a limit I have bumped heads with many times when working with VEGAS Pro, and which has been responsible for NVIDIA's driver crashing.\n\nDriver wise: AMD does tend to release more frequent updates to drivers than NVIDIA. This tends to be due to AMD's Driver QA and refinement being less robust than NVIDIA's. I have certainly noticed a few more odd glitches in games like flickering hair or invisible vehicles. Some of these could be game engine bugs. None of these bugs have resulted in games being unplayable. CS2 for example had a stutter bug which specifically affected the 7900XTX and was fixed quickly by AMD, but I really didn't notice this personally. Battlefield 2042 occasionally has a colorful hair issue on some characters, but only at the end-of-game recap. Driver crashes have been extremely minimal - I've experienced one crash which was due to a bug AMD has since fixed with CS2, but that's not to say things have been exceptionally smooth for me.\n\nThere are definitely some resource scheduling issues to work out in the drivers. When the GPU is under heavy (100%) load, you may find that stuttering occurs in other programs like web browsers and in the mouse when Alt-Tabbing at times. This hasn't resulted in the system being unusable. It's just annoying and is intermittent. I did not encounter mouse stuttering with NVIDIA, so they seem to do a better job with scheduling in that regard, but other programs (hardware accelerated Chromium apps) definitely took their time doing any sort of action with the NVIDIA card under full load. Things with this AMD card remain snappy even with the occasional stutters.\n\nThe AMD Software suite is overall pretty good. Unlike NVIDIA, AMD includes automatic driver updates, game optimizations, game performance statistics, game streaming (AMD Link), live streaming, game clipping and background recording, performance monitoring as well as overclocking features directly in AMD Software, WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT BEING REQUIRED! That is on top of the usual GPU settings for Display color/resolution, software profiles, and global 3D settings. You just install the software and everything is right there in one control panel. Some settings like monitor arrangement and color calibration, AMD Software will defer to the Windows Control panel, and this seems to be only where Windows will do a better job. I have noticed my system no longer has this strange 3-4 second freeze on boot-up when the driver package loads like I did with NVIDIA when GeForce Experience was loading in, so that's a plus.\n\nNow for the fun bits. When I initially installed the GPU, everything was pretty smooth. Run DDU, shut down the system, pull out the old GPU, install the new GPU. Everything worked on the first go. Install the AMD Drivers, Reboot, and all is fine and dandy! Within a few hours however, I started noticing some odd behavior while running games. If I had a game running on my main monitor (a 4K 144Hz HDR display), everything would be fine... until I Alt+Tabbed to use an application on my secondary monitors (two 1080p 144Hz SDR displays), or touched any application based on Chromium (Steam, Discord, Google Chrome...) while a game was running. The driver would hang for a few seconds and then recover, but not hang in the sense that my game or any applications would crash out. My primary web browser, Firefox, didn't cause any sort of problem with the driver. Thinking this was the infamous \"Chromium Hardware Acceleration\" bugs that seem to plague AMD, I considered disabling hardware acceleration in Chrome, until I considered the fact that Windows itself is not exactly behaving right.\n\nMy next troubleshooting steps involved disabling Resizable BAR (AMD Smart Access Memory), which was enabled on my Motherboard (ASUS PRIME X370 Pro) as this has been known to cause issues with NVIDIA RTX 3000 series cards, as well as the AMD RX 6000 series GPUs. Also, since I am using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D on an X370 board, it's very possible there's a strange board problem going on causing the driver to hang. So great! I turn off Resizable BAR, and the problems disappear... for about 12 hours. The problems then return with a vengeance! Simple actions like running VLC in Full Screen, full screening YouTube videos, trying to run games, basically anything an average person might do, would cause the driver to hang... and sometimes crash hard. Even more silly - mousing over the display in AMD Software was enough to hang it. To make matters worse, the system got so unstable to the point where simply loading color calibration profiles for my monitor would cause the entire video driver to hang hard just by logging into the PC!\n\nAs part of troubleshooting with Windows becoming unusable, I continued to mess around in the BIOS by disabling IOMMU, SR-IOV, Resizable BAR at a Chipset level (rather than in AMD Software), and toggled between the two BIOSs available on this GPU using the BIOS toggle switch found towards the PCI Bracket. Nothing! But by chance, I happened across the solution. While troubleshooting, I discovered that the center DisplayPort port was misbehaving. It could detect AND sync my 4K display at HDR, RGB 4:4:4, 144Hz without an issue... as if nothing was wrong. But when I connected my 1080p displays to this same port, the monitors would detect but wouldn't sync (output video). Neither one of my external monitors would sync on this port. ONLY the 4K display. The other thing I noticed is, when I didn't use the center DisplayPort port... the GPU wouldn't hang! Windows would log in! Everything worked! My setup now avoids the use of the center DisplayPort port, with one 1080p monitor connected to the HDMI port, and the remaining two monitors connected to the left-most and right-most DisplayPort port. All of the monitors are being fully driven, and my GPU is now 100% stable... even with Resizable BAR (AMD Smart Access Memory) enabled, IO-SRV, IOMMU, you name it enabled. I don't know at this point if the problem is going to require me to RMA the GPU with XFX, but given the number of complaints I've seen online regarding \"a particular port\" (like the USB-C port) on other 7900XTX GPUs from other brands, it's sounding more like an AMD Driver bug. Some people were able to temporarily resolve their hanging/freezing problems with \"a particular port\" by using DDU only to have it crop up a day later. That sounds pretty similar, doesn't it?\n\nSince figuring out the initial stability headache, the GPU has been enjoyable to use, and I do not regret the move from NVIDIA (I have been a long time NVIDIA customer FWIW - RIVA 128ZX, GeForce 4400MX, GeForce 8800GT, GeForce GTX770, GeForce 1080Ti) to AMD. The only time the driver has crashed was when I was playing CS2 on launch day, while streaming the game via Discord. I chalked that up to Discord being the problem, as I also experienced similar driver crashes on NVIDIA when game streaming in Discord. Turns out that was an AMD bug which they fixed a week later...\n\nOverall, if you're switching from NVIDIA, or are unsure about this purchase, I recommend this card. If you encounter the instability issues I first encountered... definitely think outside of the box. It's rewarding at the end."

        "review": " pour commencer cet avis, voici ma config :\n\n- Carte mère : MSI MAG B660 TomaHawk Wifi DDR4\n- Processeur : Intel Core i5 12600KF\n- RAM : Kingston Fury Beast 2x8Go (16Go) à 3200MHz (DDR4)\n- Refroidissement CPU : Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB Black Edition\n- Carte graphique : AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (XFX)\n- Alimentation : MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 (1000W) - Modulaire\n- Boîtier : Phanteks Eclipse G360A (Blanc)\n\ncommençons par le commencement : la livraison.\nj'ai pris la livraison à 9,99€, qui a été beaucoup plus rapide que prévu. le colis a été livré 3 jours après avoir passé commande, de ce côté là rien à dire. C'est DPD qui s'est chargé de la livraison et je n'ai jamais été déçu de leurs services.\n\nl'installation :\nl'installation s'est réalisée sans encombre dans mon boîtier, il faut en revanche prévoir un grand boitier pour y loger la carte car elle est vraiment mastoc ! dans le G360A ça n'a posé aucun souci.\naprès 2-3 jours d'utilisation, j'ai quand même décidé d'installer le support métallique fourni, car la carte s'affaissait un peu. le support a réglé le souci, et s'installe relativement facilement ! faites simplement attention dans votre boîtier, le support peut ne pas rentrer car il rajoute quelques centimètres à la carte, qui est elle même déjà très longue. vous pouvoir sur les photos avec et sans le support !\npour ce qui est de l'alimentation, il faut prévoir du 3x 8pins. Personnellement, j'ai opté pour une alimentation MSI de 1000W, et je n'ai aucun souci avec. Tout est correctement alimenté, pas de connecteur qui brûle (hum...), pas de black screen ou de BSOD... tout fonctionne nickel !\n\nperformances :\npour information, j'ai un setup avec 3 écrans 1080p + un volant de simulation, qui me permet de jouer sur 3 écrans à des jeux du style ETS2 ou BeamNG Drive en 5760x1080 (équivalent à de la 3k). J'ai mis en place AMD EyeFinity (équivalent du Surround chez Nvidia) pour simuler un seul écran 5760x1080, au lieu de 3 écrans 1080p, c'est ce qui me permet d'étendre les jeux sur 3 écrans. La carte graphique encaisse sans soucis ces jeux là en ultra à 75FPS (ils peuvent sans doute aller au delà, mais mes écrans sont en 75Hz, donc inutile pour moi d'aller au delà). Je ne suis franchement pas déçu des performances (et encore heureux à ce prix là...), comparé à mon ancienne CG c'est le jour et la nuit !\n\ntempératures et bench :\nde ce que j'ai vu, les températures sont maîtrisées. en lançant le jeu Tram Sim Munich, j'ai eu un peu peur quand la CG a commencé à souffler fort, mais en consultant les températures j'ai vu qu'elle ne montait pas au delà de 65°C. Le dit jeu n'est pas un jeu très optimisé comparé à par exemple ETS2, donc forcément ça tire plus sur la CG.\nj'ai lancé également un Time Spy sur 3D Mark (voir photo), j'ai obtenu 29 834 de score, ce qui est relativement dans la norme par rapport à d'autres personnes qui ont pu essayer cette carte. la carte est montée à 67°C au maximum lors du bench, ce qui est plus que convenable quand on regarde la puissance qu'elle délivre.\n\nniveau sonore :\nla carte au repos est relativement silencieuse, et pareil en jeu. lorsque je lance un jeu plus gourmand en ressources (ex. Tram Sim Munich), la carte fait plus de bruit par moment mais franchement c'est pas dérangeant, j'ai jamais mesuré plus de 45dB boîtier fermé\n\npour info, je n'ai pas testé les classiques du style Cyberpunk, CSGO, Apex... car je ne suis pas du tout friand dans ce style de jeux. je peux donner mon avis sur des jeux de simulation mais pas sur autre chose !\n\nen bref, pour jouer en 4k en ultra, c'est vraiment le top du top ! je trouve que c'est un bon compromis tarifaire par rapport à une RTX 4080, qui ne propose pas franchement plus de prestations. Certains jeux sont peut-être plus optimisés pour Nvidia (comme Cyberpunk), mais je ne suis pas sur que ça vaille le coup de débourser 300-400€ de plus dans une carte qui vous apportera un gain de 2FPS... après, c'est à vous de voir !\nAttention tout de même, vous ne pouvez pas comparer ce modèle avec une 4090, car cette carte est encore un cran au dessus par rapport à la 7900XTX.\n\nJe recommande évidemment l'achat de cette carte si vous souhaitez jouer en 4K ! Je suis ravi de mon achat, elle apporte des performances que je n'aurais jamais trouvé à ce prix là.\nEn espérant que mon avis vous aura aidé à faire votre choix ;)"

        "review": "This card is a monster performer! It's a large card at 344 mm, but much smaller than Nvidia's. And also isn't as wide as the competitor options. This will fit in most cases. The case shown is NZXT H7 Elite (max 400mm card length), and should fit in H5 (max 365mm card length) which would be tight.\n\nNot only does this card perform very well! You cannot beat the price for the performance and 24GB GDDR6 VRAM! Ample VRAM for the latest games to achieve the highest frame rates!\n\nBecause this card is not as long as some of its competitor models, it doesn't have the sag, but to even reduce the minimal say it does have, the Z-Bar is a perfect solution to keep your video card stable and from moving around. The card in that picture is perfectly parallel to the system board. It screws to the end of the card with nice countersunk screws and supports the card with not only the two existing slots that the video card takes up, but the two slots below it just for mounting purposes.\n\nRegarding power connectors, this card has three standard 8-pin 12 volt connectors. No funky adapter cable or custom modular cable to PSU.\n\nThis awesome video card has two video BIOS options with just a flick of the switch. When I first booted system, I kept it in normal clocking, once CPU and RAM were verified to be operating at max performance, then I flipped the switch to get extra FPS by slightly raising core clock and VRAM clock. With this card, switch position left towards the video ports is standard clocking, to the right towards the power connectors is the OC BIOS.\n\nThe case has sufficient cooling and the video card never gets above 60c with the hardcore testing I had done before giving it to my daughter after she helped me build it.\n\nBe careful to pick the correct power supply! The CPU is AMD 7800X3D and they both require at least 850W quality PSU. The supply in this rig, not shown is an EVGA 1000 G5. My general rule of thumb which may conflict with others is that the power supply should be rated 20% more than the max peak load as to not tax the PSU at 100% load. Even though this is a large power supply in a small package, it is very efficient and only draws as much power that is required. Very little wasted energy and heat that I could determine just by putting my hand over the air vents while maxing out CPU and GPU.\n\nHaving a UPS connected is a good idea to protect your expensive hardware, plus you get a readout of how many watts is being consumed from all devices plugged into it. It's not as accurate as using lab equipment for power supply consumption, but is good enough for getting a good idea how much your rig is consuming.\n\nFinal thoughts, I would buy this card again! I bought this hardware for my daughter's computer and I am thinking about building a dark gray, all black inside, no RGB for myself with the same video card! Apparently Nvidia is having issues with their latest drivers, they seem to be going backwards while AMD is going forward. Wtf? Thank you AMD for your awesome hardware! Much better bang for the buck going all AMD versus Intel and/or Nvidia. The FPS proves that to no doubt that AMD is superior! My crappy 2017 Alienware 17 M4 portable desktop with lid (as they call laptop) has Intel and Nvidia and that thing overheats all the time. I've repasted that at least three times and is ready for the fourth time. Thank you thermal grizzly extreme!"

        "review": "Je lorgnais les offres de NR Info depuis un petit moment. Je ne connaissais pas XFX et j'ai vu des avis contradictoires sur ce constructeur, surtout sur les anciens modèles datant des générations précédentes aux RDNA2/RDNA3.\nA priori, XFX est un constructeur chinois qui faisait autant des cartes Nvidia que AMD pour se centrer uniquement sur AMD. Ce qui fait que c'est l'un des seuls constructeurs à ne pas réutiliser un Design Nvidia pour l'adapter sur les cartes AMD.\nLa série Merc semble la plus aboutie de leurs cartes. La 7900 XTX en impose vraiment et on sent que les matériaux sont de qualité !\n\nJ'ai également eu des doutes concernant NR Info, ce vendeur basé au Portugal, se nomme Neuronios Radicais lda. La société n'existe que depuis 2019 et se concentre uniquement sur la vente de carte XFX...\n\nA la commande il m'était proposé 2 tarifs de livraison. J'ai pris le moins cher des 2, à moins de 10€. Au final j'ai reçu la carte 1 jour avant l'option tarifée plus cher (aux alentours de 50€). Donc extrêmement satisfait par la livraison d'autant plus que le transporteur (DPD / Chronopost) s'est avéré très sérieux en prenant contact avant la livraison pour s'assurer que je puisse bien la réceptionner.\n\nConcernant la carte, elle dispose d'un commutateur pour paramétrer le BIOS en mode silence ou débridé.\nEn mode débridé, la carte monte, au maximum, à 70-75°C en pleine charge dans un boîtier moyennement optimisé en flux d'air. Les ventilos se font un peu entendre, mais comme je joue au casque, je ne les entends plus.\n\nAu niveau des performances, les fréquences de la mémoire restent aux alentours de 2500MHz sans s'effondrer alors que la fréquence du GPU monte à presque 3GHz, sans optimisation particulière !\n\nAvant cette carte, j'ai également eu une MSI GeForce 3080 10G. Elle chauffait davantage que la XFX Merc 7900XTX et ses performances se bridait automatiquement dans mon boîtier, ce qui était assez frustrant. Je suis dons assez étonné et satisfait par l'efficacité de la carte XFX dans ce domaine.\n\nJe joue actuellement au jeu réputé le moins optimisé pour les cartes AMD, c'est à dire Cyberpunk 2077. En WHD (2560 x 1080, soit 75% de la 2k), le jeu est fluide avec plus de 60-80FPS en RayTracing Ultra !\nLe jeu gagne un peu en fluidité en Rasteristion (sans Ray Tracing) mais comme le jeu est parfaitement jouable avec le RayTracing, je le laisse activé.\n\nJe joue également à APEX Legends. Dans ce cas, pas de souci, je bride même la carte à 200FPS (la limite de mon écran) et tout est extrêmement fluide. A noter qu'Apex Legends donne un sentiment de latence en 60-80FPS là où Cyberpunk paraît fluide pour les même fréquences d'image ...\n\nSur un jeu comme Modern Warfare, aucune surprise, le jeu est également extrêmement fluide, mais il tournait déjà bien sur une Radeon 6600XT.\n\nEt enfin, sur un Battlefiel V, en Raytracing, ça lague au début, puis ça devient jouable, mais il est vite nécessaire de désactiver le Raytracing pour garantir la fluidité du jeu. C'était également le cas avec ma 3080.\n\nJe suis également confiant pour l'avenir, on sent que les pilotes ne sont pas encore optimizés et les performances et la qualité sont déjà là. Ça ne peut être que meilleur avec le temps, ce qui est une excellente nouvelle.\n\nEnfin, avec 61Tflops annoncés en FP32, cette carte est plus puissante en rasterisation que la RTX4080 (49TFlops) pour 200-300 € de moins. Pour le Raytracing, on est au dessus d'une RTX3090Ti, ce qui est déjà plus que suffisant. Et la désactivation du RayTracing ne nuit pas à la beauté des jeux. J'avais déjà fait ce constat sur la 3080 qui, de toutes façons, ne tenait pas la route dans ce mode si on veut jouer dans de bonnes conditions.\n\nj'ai longtemps hésité avec une 4080 qui semble assurer davantage en Raytracing ... mais je préfère miser sur une carte me permettant de jouer de façon fluide à tous les jeux en rasterisation. Dans ce cas la 4080 est moins performante et je préfère la fluidité à quelques effets de reflets auxquels on ne fait pas gaffe dans le feu de l'action."

        "review": "The 40 series is worth upgrading to, in the end. The 4070Ti was the best price/performance/power consumption ratio by far, so much so that it was a no brainer for me to settle for it over the 4090. I'm keeping this review shorter than I normally would, since even though I'm an expert at this point I think im just gonna give the main points here and not get overly specific.\n\n1)To be competetive in the new AI machine learning world nvidia has a distinct advantage, I'm glad im not struggling with a higher specced AMD card without the damn drivers to give me all the massive speed and efficiency increases that these NVIDIA drivers give me, period. Sry I love AMD too and my chip is nothing other than the meaty and equally mighty Threadripper, but Iove and need are two different things and I need performance and compatibility guaranteed out of anything I pay 800 bucks for.\n\n2)Since I'm developing AI based products my mileage will vary from anyone buying this to play a videogame with, all I can say is I wish i had 800 bucks to waste on videogames lol. I'm sure the card is a beast on videogames too but i honestly just wouldn't know, I did a vanity benchmark on some free new TombRaider game that I'll never play and was pleased that the fps was through the roof at highest settings and stopped to reminisce an actually play in some ultrasmooth Borderlands before I got back to work.\n\n3)The price :(\n\n4)Amazon extended me some credit to buy it over a few payments, so these past four months have been the most productive months in my company's history due to being able to afford this equipment that has been performing solidly and reliably nonstop almost 24/7 since purchase.\n\n5)Finally, the 1800 dollar question. Do I regret, after 4 months buying this unit over the 4900? The honest answer is this: Yes, but hell no. Yes, If I had a card twice as fast as this one I wouldn't burst into tears of sadness. But no, I would burst into tears of sadness if it cost me my only remaining kidney what am I supposed to pee with NVIDIA and AMD? Does the 4900 come with a mechanical kidney or at least a promo code towards one instead of FIFA 2026? If so then ok I wish I would've bought the 4900 even thought it would have cost twice the power to use 24/7, so my power company will be twice as happy. I honestly dont know, if I have more customers then the 4090 may become a necessity, but I'm not looking forward to it.\n\n6)There u have it, I hope even though it only covered the basics, like yes if you get it for machine learning you will be very glad you did and have a card that is more than capable of cranking out professional production level product with efficiency, speed, power savings, economical, plug and play compatibility with every thing type of performance. you're welcome. Would not recommend to my competition."

The best graphics cards cost more than some complete gaming pc’s. It’s a hefty endeavor. If you have the money to burn, I highly recommend this video card…with a caveat. Make sure you have room in your pc to house this monster card. My own Omen pc did not have the room which led to a pair of pliers and a forfeited warranty to alter wasted space inside the case. I’ve owned my Omen computer for nearly two years now so I’m not really worried about the warranty part. But, had I not been the crafty, make it work, kinda person that I am, I would have likely ended up with a card I couldn’t use (full disclosure, I upgraded from a 3080 RTX card).\nBottom line: Awesome graphics card at a price that would make Warren Buffett do a double take.

But nevertheless, I think this card is pretty budget friendly, you can probably find a good deal on a 4070 somewhere else but I think for 1080 gaming its good."

My 1660S couldn't max out 1080p games but this one does easily. Can even play at 1440p on some games maxed. I had 3 main criteria for a graphics card. One: It would need to be way better than what I had. Two: It needed to fit in my 8940 case. Three: my 360W PSU needed to be able to power it. This card fit my needs perfectly. I only had a 6 pin power connector so I did have to buy a 6 pin to 8 pin adapter but that has been working perfectly. There are a lot of negative videos about this card, mainly regarding its price, but for me, it's just what I needed. 5 stars."

And it's already working great.\n(most people can probably just NOT install the Asus software and just toggle the physical switch on the card. I leave mine in the \"Silent\" mode or whatever it's called... oh, I also use the \"OSD\" in the Asus software to monitor the GPU Usage, FPS etc if I'm trying to figure out if I have a CPU bottleneck and tweak a game as the Window Game Bar wasn't showing GPU Usage correctly.

But I have one bug bear overall, this card is supposed to be eligible for one month of Adobe Creative Cloud, but unfortunately it's impossible to redeem the offer on the Asus website. When I try to redeem the offer, it says “The 90 number 90YV0IZ2-M0AA00 of serial number entered is not eligible for this event”, which is the model number not the serial number. Or I get “The product serial number is not applicable to this event” when I enter the serial number. I have a support ticket into Asus to try to resolve the issue and will change my review to reflect the outcome. I choose the Asus card because the Adobe Creative Cloud offer was worth $70 CAN, so I purchased that card over a competitor as the offer effectively lowered the price, as I'm already a Creative Cloud subscriber."

It had a very loud coil whine while under load and performed under average for a 2080 Super on 3DMark benchmarks. None of that was grounds for a RMA according to Gigabyte (and I'll never buy from them again). It eventually started black screening 2 months after the warranty expired. Anyways - this ASUS GeForce RTX 4070 OC is its replacement, and I couldn't be happier. It more than doubled my performance on 3DMark stress tests (again - take with a grain of salt. My 2080 Super was trash) and runs dead quiet and maxes out around 60C even when under load rendering as many frames as it can. Absolutely thrilled with the performance gain and the price/value ratio of this card. GCs are overpriced in general and that's no secret, but given the current situation, I think this card is insanely good for its $599 MSRP."

VSR is also super nice to use on YouTube so I get daily use from this card whether gaming or enjoying videos. It is great having 3080-level performance at only 225w drawn. Price point could be a bit lower to be on par with AMD offerings: this card is a much fairer value at $500-$550 if you can wait for a deal.\n\nI recommend a 700w minimum power supply in case of transient loads."

I run Ubuntu linux and it handles my day-to-day job tasks as a software engineer easily, driving my two 4K monitors. I play games through Steam, such as the Tomb Raider games, Factorio, and Transport Fever 2. It can definitely deliver those games at 4K, but you might have to tweak some settings to keep the FPS up for the Tomb Raider games*, which I run at 2K at the highest settings with no problem. At maximum load, it generally doesn't go over 60C. It also handles Stable Diffusion well, even if I'm doing other things simultaneously!\n\n*Again, this is on Linux-- Windows performance is probably better."

        "review": "MSI Radeon RX 6650 XT MECH 2X 8G OC.\nPremetto che è stata presa a 359€ e che MSI si conferma tra i marchi più affidabili riguardo alla qualità complessiva e alla dissipazione delle vram (cosa tutt'altro che scontata negli altri marchi).\nIn breve si può dire che passando da una nVidia 1050Ti a marchio Colorful (tra le migliori in circolazione) a questa si nota subito il cambio di \"esperienza\". Ovvero si passa da un ambiente \"Apple-like\" chiavi in mano, nel quale dopo aver montano la scheda e installati i drivers bene o male anche se non sei un utente avanzato riesci ad ottenere un buon 80% di quello per cui hai pagato senza troppi intoppi, ad un ambiente più adatto a chi vuole sporcarsi le mani con driver molto più configurabili, convoluti, versatili e decisamente più moderni della controparte verde.\nCerto è che quando hai più libertà di azione puoi sia ottenere di più dalla scheda ma anche incappare spesso in tentativi falliti, con conseguenti crash o strani problemi a cui non si è abituati. La verità è che con AMD bisogna mettersi l'anima in pace sul fatto che bisognerà trovare un punto di equilibrio tra le varie impostazioni per trovare quelle ottimali per la scheda acquistata (e intendo letteralmente l'esemplare unico in questione). Non ho quantificato ma diciamo che la 1050Ti che usavo prima anche se undervoltata e overclockata era potente un quarto di questa 6650XT e che consumava a riposo più del doppio (47watt in windows senza applicazioni aperte usando un monitor a 144hz contro gli attuali 18-19watt) e sotto sforzo anche di più (diciamo intorno agli 80w se bella tirata sia su core che sulle vram contro gli attuali 30-36watt con impostazioni di qualità persino più alte). Voi direte, conveniente! Sì ma ciò che si risparmia in denaro e in consumi energetici si paga in tempo da passare ad ottimizzare, e badate che le impostazioni di \"auto overclock\" e \"auto undervolt\" fornite dal pannello amd sono abbastanza inutili. Per dire mi veniva consigliato un undervolt intorno ai 1150mv quando le prestazioni migliori le ottengo a 810mv con consumi ridicoli, temperature glaciali (si parla di un hotspot attorno ai 49-53° sotto sforzo con fps cappati a 72) e le memorie non superano i 64°. Ultimo consiglio: astenersi chi non è pratico e comprate una nvidia e chi mira ad fps sopra agli 80-90. In tal caso la scheda diventa rumorosa sia come coil while (niente di atroce ma si sente un certo sibilo con case chiuso sotto la scrivania) che come ventole che putroppo pur essendo buone hanno un numero di giri estremamente elevato a mio avviso. Probabilmente in tal senso è meglio puntare sulla Sapphire Nitro+ 6650XT, la quale putroppo sbrilluccica di un inutile presenza di RGB, necessita altro software per gestirla al meglio e costa quantomeno 100€ in più. Quindi per chi fosse deciso a prendere questa assicuratevi prima di saper usare MSI afterburner, Rivatuner (quantomeno per cappare gli fps) e smanettate bene con i profili dei programmi così da salvare le impostazioni adeguate per ogni singolo software. Ad ogni crash del driver le impostazioni si resettano a default come procedura di sicurezza, quindi meglio avere un profilo salvato per ogni software.\nLa scheda è molto più piccola di quanto mi aspettassi, avrei sperato in un blocco dissipatore più consistente sinceramente questo non regge bene più di 100watt. Certo la scheda non si squaglierà e AMD verrà sempre a dirvi che fino a 100 e passa gradi è tutto \"normale\" ma è chiaro che per un uso domestico con temperature in stanza non condizionate che possono superare i 31 gradi d'estate non è contemplabile l'uso di una scheda del genere al wattaggio massimo dichiarato. Per quanto mi riguarda è utopìa.\nIn conclusione: \"Colorful\" e \"MSI\" sono tra i pochi marchi che mi ispirano fiducia. Se Colorful producesse anche schede AMD le comprerei e se avessi letto come titolo \"MSI 6650XT Suprim X\" probabilmente avrei speso volentieri qualcosa di più per quella. :P PRECISAZIONE: I risultati sopracitati sono stati ottenuti con \"PCIe x8 3.0\" e senza \"Smart Access Memory\" o \"Resizable Bar\" che dir si voglia, in quanto la scheda madre su cui è al momento montata è datata."

I gave it a 1/5 stars for value however because the 4080 only comes with 16gb of VRAM vs its competitor at similar performance levels the Radeon 7900 XTX comes with 24gb of VRAM and nearly identical price. I only picked NVIDIA over AMD because AMD hasnt yet got a really good Frame Generation performance and struggles with Ray Tracing in many games compared to NVIDIA. Hardware Unboxing did great comparisons between the two and the difference is huge for RT. It will probably be another year or more before they release drivers that address those issues.\n\nOverall the ZOTAC is a very good card if you pick Geforce RTX 4080. Any other decent alternatives will cost you at least another 200 bucks and its already overpriced enough as it is. Its a no-brainer choice tbh."

It came packed perfectly, and came with an anti sag bracket, and a 16 pin to 3x 8 pin connector cable. The cable quality is incredible and is fairly flexible.\n\nI call this a beast not just because of its performance, but also because of its size. It’s a massive GPU and it barely fit in my NZXT H5 Flow which is mid tower case. My aio radiator is placed on the top and the Gpu had just 7mm space left in the front. When I close my side panel, it does bend the cables just a bit, but doesn’t cause any noticeably extreme cable bending. It takes up 3 slots at the back.\n\nIn terms of performance, this card has handled pretty much every game I’ve thrown at it wonderfully. I play all my games on 1440p Ultra settings with everything set to max and I’ve got the best fps and quality out of it. DLSS Quality setting has been incredible. The temperature always hovers between 51-65 deg Celsius on full load and stays at around 35-38 deg Celsius on idle.\n\nThe card is also super quiet and has no coil whine at all (I’ve read a few people mention that this model has coil whine) and it runs very cool."

        "review": "I've had mine for a few months now. It's definitely the upgrade that I wanted from my 6 year old GTX 1080 ti. However the price is ridiculous. Over $1200 for a single GPU!? That a bit much in my opinion. I had the cash at the time and needed to build a new PC immediately when I bought it, so this was the only acceptable option for me. Yeah I could've gotten one of the cheaper AMD GPUs that had better pricing, but they tend to have issues with drivers for several years from both my experience and that of my friends. So at the end of the day this was my only choice as I wasn't going spend even one penny more than what I had spent on this GPU. Which was around $1200. But enough of talking about the ridiculous prices for current gen GPUs. How's this thing perform? Pretty darn well. Games that my 1080 ti struggled to run at 1440p are running butter smooth now. Though, that's to be expected. A 6 year old GPU that can still run plenty of games pretty well will pale in comparison to the latest tech. I've even run some games with ray tracing on with decent FPS. Even better with DLSS 3. Is the ray tracing feature worth it. Not really. DLSS 3 is great and all with boosting frame rates, but ray tracing really tanks your FPS. DLSS 3 also has issues sometimes with visual artifacts from what I've heard. I haven't seen any myself. However, I only have a handful of games that support the feature, so I can't really verify how true that is. Now onto the one thing I do love about this GPU. It's quiet. My 1080 ti always made tons of noise. Probably because I didn't have the best case for cool temperatures. My current case has great airflow and this monster of a GPU has a massive heatsink that makes good use of the high airflow. The hottest I've gotten it so far is 70⁰C. And that's only for brief instances. Most of the time my temps are around 65-67⁰C when under heavy loads. Somehow it manages to stay at though temps even with the fans really ramping up. It's honestly reached the point of me not even noticing the fan noise unless I take off my gaming headset. Overall, it's a great GPU. My gripe with it is the price. Nvidia will tell you that ray tracing and DLSS are the future. Honestly though, I'm not sure about that. They're great features to have when they work and ya know, ray tracing doesn't cause framerate to tank even with DLSS. Honestly, both features feel like they're not ready to really be heavily marketed yet. The tech still has room to improve before this becomes a good selling point for any GPU. That said if you can pick this up for a cheaper price, do it. Right now, I can't recommend this product at full price. It shouldn't cost more than $1000 and even then I'd say that's still too much. $800 is about the right price for this GPU. That said, if you got money to burn, it's not a bad GPU definitely worth it if you have an old 10 series card like mine."

I'm getting 160-220% increases across the board, which is awesome.\n\nObviously, this card offers little value for money, as Nvidia's pricing is absurd, but if you want to game comfortable at 100fps with everything maxed out at 3440x1440, this thing will get you there no sweat whatsoever.\n\nI'm docking it one point in the overall rating because of the noise, however. For whatever reason, Zotac DOES NOT allow you to set your fan speed lower than 30%, and at 30% their fans are notably noisy. Why pretty much every other manufacturer allows you to just sit at 0% or 5% when your PC is idling or you're just browsing etc, but Zotac seems to feel the need to just pipe noise into your room is a little beyond my understanding. People have been complaining about this for almost a year now, and Zotac pretends like its nose bleeds.\n\nIf you can afford it, and if noise doesn't bother you (it's not super loud, just notable because the rest of my PC is whisper quiet), and you want to game at triple digit levels, this is a great card."

(Note: You will not know this until you open the box and see the12VHPWR cable or see it in the manual in 2.5 point font.)\n\nSecond, there is a button next to where you plug in the12VHPWR connector. This is for the DUAL BIOS on the card. There should be a red LED light there as well. This will indicate that the card is running in Performance Mode.

        "review": "As someone who's always used Nvidia gpus and wanted to upgrade my 3060, the 7800XT is my first Radeon gpu. I've been using this gpu for a month now and I will say I've had a few different bugs on the AMD side I never dealt with on the Nvidia side. I had one night where it wouldn't open any game but a simple reboot would fix it. (The issue hasn't replicated since, seemed to be one time). Recently I've been playing D2R maxed out at 1440p and it looks and plays great with this gpu but sometimes when I close it for some reason it will crash. (Seemed to be gone after the most recent driver update). I never had issues like that with that on my 3060, but it doesn't seem to be anything more then minor inconveniences. As a whole I would say for 500 bucks this is a good gpu but if you go team red I feel like you might want to be someone who enjoys pc building, tinkering and troubleshooting more often then Nvidia. If you want a gpu to just work and call it a day get a 4070, but this is a better card at this price if you are a tech person like myself and don't mind working with hardware. Also as a side note if you are coming from a Nvidia gpu to a AMD gpu make sure to do a DDU and remove all of the Nvidia drivers properly before installing AMD ones or you could potentially have a bad time.\n\nPros\n---\n-Better then the 4070 in pure power for cheaper.\n-AMD Adrenaline software is good. (Live gaming fps counters, overclocking tools, undervolt tools, etc)\n-10-15 degrees overall cooler system while gaming.\n-Dual Bios\n\nCons\n---\n-Very large gpu (Check case compatibility).\n-RT performance isn't as good as the 40 series.\n-If you mind troubleshooting or dealing with odd as I call them \"AMD issues\" or use your system for professional business, I'd suggest going for a Nvidia gpu.\n-Currently features such as anti-lag+, RSR, and FSR are inferior to Nvidia's upscaling and DLSS in maturity."

Power Color did a great job with this card.\n\nPros:\n- Factory OC works perfectly\n- Solid metal frame (still need a support or it will droop)\n- Fans rarely kick on, mine runs at 54C at full usage in a ~70F basement\n- No RGB software to download, only a slider button for colors: ice blue, amethyst, & OFF)\n- Significant improvement in every game over an EVGA 3070\n- Thinner and lighter than my older EVGA 3070\n\nCons:\n- Ray-tracing sucks, which I knew because RT is an Nvidia technology. For me, it's not a big deal.\n- Ran hotter when I tried a vertical install, horizontal seems better for the airflow on this card since fans rarely kick on.\n- No RGB customization, which I don't care for anyway. Go for the Red Devil if you want RGB.\n\nThe Hellhound comes with a dual-BIOS option: OC (default) and silent, but I would stick with OC. Benchmarks I've seen show little extra heat, but good FPS improvements. For those curious, the Hellhound is basically the same as the Red Devil version, but without the RGB and not quit as high an overclock. The heatsink is the same. For the price, it's better.\n\nNo coil whine on mine. But if you experience coil whine, buy a new power supply first, like a Platinum rated. Bad PSU's tend to cause more coil whine than the a bad card. Also, remember to use 2 cables for the 8-pin connectors, don't use both sets of connectors on the same cable."

Doesn’t hold to the case well at all, the card just pushes it from where you stick it, mind you if the card was traditionally mounted and I just needed it to hold vertical weight it would be fine.\n\nI’m also not sure if my support piece was bent.

Tienen un rendimiento muy similar en la mayoría de los juegos. Con la 3060 podía configurar casi todo al máximo en 1080 con un rango de 60 a 120 fps dependiendo del juego.\n\nCon la 4060 puedo mantener el rango similar de fps con la configuración al máximo, se puede apreciar una ganancia de 10 o 20 fps en muchos casos, así como un comportamiento más estable. Algo que también puede apreciar fue el hecho de meterle más carga a la tarjeta y mantener los fps que me ofrecía la 3060.\n\nEjemplos\n- El particular con Gta V, que puedo poner todo al máximo y tener arriba de 75 fps, cosa que la 3060 sufría de caídas hasta de 45. La 4060 ofrece un promedio de 80-90fps en la mayoría de zonas.\n- En Warzone 2, la 3060 ofrece 100-110fps al mínimo y unos 70 al máximo. La 4060 da 120fps al mínimo aproximadamente y 100-110fps en la configuración \"Extremo\", la más alta. En este caso, me parece que mi procesador está limitando la 4060 en gráficos al mínimo, he visto que ofrece hasta 170fps en promedio. Es curioso que en este juego, la 4060 con gráficos al máximo me ofrezca los mismo fps que la 3060 con gráficos al mínimo.\n- En Red Dead Redemption 2, he visto poco aumento de fps con una configuración casi al máximo que utilizaba en la 3060. Pero si puedo afirmar que son más estable, sin mencionar que el rango de fps en la 3060 con DLSS es de 60 a 80 y, en la 4060 es de 60-100.\n\nNo he probado juegos con DLSS 3 aún, esta ha sido mi experiencia hasta el momento. Recomiendo mucho esta gráfica, no me parece mala en lo absoluto. Sin embargo, el cambio de 3060 a 4060 es innecesario. Pero, si estás indeciso entre comprar 3060 o 4060, vale más comprar una 4060, por experiencia."

I had one before the one I just bought, and not being nearly as experienced with computers, I never monitored its temperature and it likely toasted itself over time. The new one, however, is working like a charm. If I have a tip for you, it's this.\n\nStep 1: Go to the searchbar on the bottom left and type choose a power plan, and then open.\nStep 2: You'll see the balanced (recommended) one. Click change plan settings.\nStep 3: Click change advanced power settings.\nStep 4: You'll see a list with some plus signs left of various things. Click the plus sign to the left of \"processor power management\".\nStep 5: Click the plus sign next to \"maximum processor state\".\nStep 6: Click the number (I assume it will be 100%) and change it to 85%.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll limit the amount of power your CPU receives. Now, this isn't dangerous, provided you don't set the number really low. I first set it to 70% while following a video. Then I slowly increased it to 85%, and I noticed an insane drop in temperature (around 20-30c) while playing various games. Red Dead Redemption 2, for instance, was cooking my CPU beforehand, and then I turned down the variable and the high temperatures were gone. Now, does it affect performance in any way? It....can. The 5600G is a 6 core, 12 thread processor. When setting it to 85%, the base clock of 3.90GHZ dropped to around 3-3.16GHZ for me. I've noticed zero affect on performance. If there is an affect to performance, it would be a few frames in games, MAYBE. If that. And for browsing the web, I have yet to notice anything. Now of course, if you're planning to use the 5600G as an APU solely (if you don't have a graphics card), then I would be a little more careful with lowering the variable. But if you have a graphics card then I wouldn't worry at all. Some people don't recommend the card because \"it's not good enough\", but how is it not good enough? It shatters web browsing, gaming, streaming, and basically everything that the average PC gamer does on their machine. If we're talking about more advanced activities, then yeah. You might want a CPU that has more cores, or one that is able to reach a higher speed and overclock. If you're planning to build a computer that is just gonna game at 1080p-1440p with some web browsing, Discord and streaming on the side, it's the CPU for you. Just pay attention to your temperatures. The last 5600G I had cooked under my nose. Ryzens get pretty hot."

While this CPU has half the L3 cache of a Ryzen 5 5600X it has the same amount of L3 cache as the older Ryzen 7 but runs at the same speed as the 5600X. This CPU plays all my games better than the older 7 CPU, without the problems (random lockups) so I am very pleased with this CPU. An additional bonus is that this CPU has internal graphics so if my GPU dies, I will still be able to use my computer, even if only to order a new graphics card."

        "review": "Mi sarebbe piaciuto dare il massimo per questo piccolo mostriciattolo, ma poi ho pensato ad alcune lacune che tecnicamente ci vengono fornite di proposito per discernere il prodotto da quelli passati che invece avevano prezzi altissimi, ma anche da quelli nuovi appartenenti a categorie leggermente superiori.\nSi parte da un assunto: questa CPU appartiene al filone Cezanne, serie di CPU AMD lanciate sul mercato nel 2021.\nIl nome in codice si riferisce al “grosso core” che può processare fino a 12 thread (6 core fisici).\nDalla serie 3000 AMD ci ha abituato ad un IPC (Istruzioni per Clock) superiore rispetto ai passati Ryzen.\nIn questo scenario troviamo un Ryzen 5 5600G, dove la ‘G’ del suffisso indica la presenza di Acceleratore Grafico integrato…una Vega 7, a quanto pare!\nNOTA: dalla mia esperienza una tale trovata ci costa, rispetto alle ipotetiche versioni sprovviste di GPU, dalle 30 alle 40€ in più.\n\nIl processore in questione viene fornito con un dissipatore e ventola che, apparentemente, somiglia a quelli progettati da Intel da almeno un decennio…ci accorgeremo che NON è così (leggere dopo).\n\nIl processore ha 1331 collegamenti al sistema ed il suo alloggiamento è AM4: “mOPGA-1331” significa che avremo una serie di segnali che servono al controllo, a veicolare indirizzi ma anche dati! (attenzione alla scheda madre che andrete ad acquistare quindi!!!).\n\nHo comprato questa CPU per risparmiare essenzialmente, ma questo risparmio si traduce in piccole mancanze che, in parte, sono state colmate da un aumento importante della frequenza.\n\n#CPU\n6 core fisici => nuclei elaborazione comprendenti una serie di circuiti per effettuare calcoli (ALU) ma anche un percorso dati per comunicare con le periferiche principali (data path); tutto ciò e coadiuvato da una serie di registri (“memorie veloci” come la CPU) che contengono “parole” in bit (cifre binarie composte da 0 e da 1 interpretati da segnali elettrici corrispondenti).\n12 thread => il thread è un mini processo. Per processo si intende l’astrazione dei programmi in esecuzione visto dal livello del Sistema Operativo. Il thread è collaborativo nei confronti di altri processi e di altri thread, mentre il processo tende, per natura di programmazione, ad essere esoso di risorse HW. [tecnologia denominata da Intel come HyperThreading o ‘SMT’ in casa AMD].\n\nLa cache è una memoria detta “tampone” contente istruzioni e dati: questa è veloce (ha tempi di accesso) similmente a quelli della CPU e serve ad evitare di interpellare la memoria principale (RAM) che ha tempi di accesso 10 volte superiori.\nIn questo caso, avremo una cache leggermente “generosa” di 16MB nella sua declinazione di terzo Livello (L3) [rispetto agli 8-12MB che mi sarei aspettato in passato].\nOra, questa capacità si rifletterà sicuramente nei programmi intensivi ed esosi di risorse, soprattutto quelli multimediali e di calcolo che richiedono sequenziali accessi ai dati più svariati.\nIl tutto è coadiuvato, internamente al processore, da una frequenza operativa della CPU sostenuta: quella base è di 3,9GHz e si arriva, step per step in comunione con l’uso dei core, fino a 4,4GHz.\nLa potenza dissipata è di 65W!\n\nLe memorie supportate, grazie al controller di memoria integrato nella CPU, sono DDR4 fino a 3200MHz …a seconda della scheda madre potremo “overcloccare” le frequenze della RAM (modalità XPM). Personalmente ho comprato delle RAM che erano veloci proprio quanto i valori, formalmente, massimi supportati.\nNOTA: rispetto ad Intel il controller della memoria ha delle latenze superiori, questo in via generale e non specifico. Ciò implica dei ritardi nella fase, cosiddetta, di ‘fetch”, cioè il prelevamento dei dati dalla memoria. Per questo motivo, per pura compensazione si è deciso di inserire una L3 corposa, proprio per garantire una predizione del dato/istruzione più ampia possibile (criterio spazio-temporale del fetch).\n\n#Come va?\nIn pratica, visto le qualità tecniche di questa CPU, l’ho messa subito alla prova.\nAbbiamo risultati che lambiscono le capacità di un core i9-10900k (col quale perde ovviamente in multi thread, ma ha simili prestazioni con 1 solo mini processo)…in pratica si trova tra un i7-8700k (col quale vince in multi thread) e un Ryzen 7 3700X (col quale vince solo in single thread).\nMesso a confronto con altre CPU, anche del recente passato, posso asserire che ci troviamo dinnanzi a una CPU che si va valere, soprattutto in single thread.\n\nIn pratica è un degno sostituto del 3700X col quale è, in media, sovrapponibile.\nOvviamente, parlo di prestazioni medie, ci saranno degli scenari nei quali ci sarà sicuramente un vincitore ma saremo limitati a quegli specifici ambiti applicativi (tanti thread occupati).\n\nAnche la frequenza sostenuta darà una mano…penso al rendering 3D, alla fluido-modellazione, ai programmi di calcolo...\nOvviamente esistono CPU che vanno meglio in scenari complessi e multi-thread ma parliamo pur sempre della fascia medio-bassa con questo 5600G.\n\nMorale?\nIl prodotto AMD è un validissimo piccolo “mostriciattolo” che ci potrà anche far giocare in Full HD con schede video di fascia medio-bassa (anche media – penso alla RX 6600 o alle RTX 3060 8GB…senza tralasciare le vecchie RX 470/480 4GB/8GB, anche la mia stessa GTX 1050 Ti da 4GB…).\nQuindi avremo una piccola stazione multimediale che farà di tutto senza mostrare il fianco MAAAA…sì, c’è un ma e riguarda la ventola del dissipatore!\n\nLa ventola, confrontata con quella del mio vecchissimo i5-3470, nonostante le dimensioni maggiori, porta a creare un fastidioso ronzio accentuato…come se qualcuno picchiettasse a frequenza altissima con le unghie su di un tavolo.\nQuesto implica che si sentirà accelerare per via della rotazione nel momento in cui demandiamo alla CPU più calcoli…essa girerà in modo tale da accelerare e decelerare.\nSe abbiamo un audio di sottofondo magari quest’effetto si riduce altrimenti nel silenzio della stanza si percepirà questo sibilo incostante.\nHo una Gigabyte B550 Aorus Elite e nel BIOS ho provato a cambiare impostazioni del raffreddamento passando da Normale ad un profilo più conservativo ma alla fine non è cambiato tantissimo.\nCredo che AMD abbia risparmiato su questo componente per offrire un prezzo sotto le 130€.\n\n#GPU\nUna Vega 7 alla frequenza di 1900MHz massimo.\nHa 448 Shading Units e ovviamente 7 core.\nHa prestazioni molto vicine a Vega 11 trovato sul Ryzen 5 2400G che a sua volta era simile ad una Radeon HD 7770 o una GTX 460v2.\nHo provato dei videogames come Tomb Raider del 2014, Doom del 2016 e partivano tranquillamente anche se non al massimo, così come Trine. Certo, non sono le ultime novità ma hanno ancora qualcosa da dire.\n\nIl mio acquisto si è perfezionato per 125,52€!\n\nNOTA: chi ha un i7-7700, i7-7700k, i7-6700k, i7-4790k, i5-8400/9400 oppure AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Ryzen 7 1700X/1800X e via dicendo può fare il salto di convenienza.\nLe prestazioni, in ogni caso, sono vicinissime ad una i3-12100F (che però non ha la GPU).\nLa CPU in esame risulta competitiva, ma dovremo (per chi soffre di fastidio della ventola) optare per un dissipatore con ventola migliore.\n\nPer l’esperienza avuta do un voto di 7,8/10 => 4 stelle per un rapporto qualità/prezzo favorevolissimo che si scontra con alcuni peccatucci veniali come la ventola rumorosa e la latenza del controller di memoria (in parte compensato dalla cache L3 corposa)."

Il passaggio da un vecchio processore è stato come passare da una bicicletta a un'auto sportiva. I tempi di caricamento sono rapidissimi, e i giochi che in passato facevano fatica a girare ora scorrono senza alcun problema. L'architettura Zen 3 ha dimostrato tutto il suo valore, garantendo una fluidità di gioco senza rivali.\n\nUna delle caratteristiche che più mi ha impressionato è la gestione termica. Nonostante le elevate prestazioni, la temperatura rimane sorprendentemente sotto controllo. Anche durante sessioni di gioco intense, il processore mantiene una temperatura costante, eliminando qualsiasi preoccupazione legata al surriscaldamento.\n\nL'abilità di multitasking è stata un'altra piacevole sorpresa. Ora posso eseguire diverse applicazioni contemporaneamente senza percepire alcun calo di prestazioni. Posso giocare a un titolo impegnativo, registrare il gameplay e gestire lo streaming in modo fluido e senza sforzo.\n\nL'overclocking è un gioco da ragazzi con il Ryzen 5 5600G. Grazie alla sua architettura solida e stabile, ho spinto le prestazioni al massimo senza alcun problema. Il processore si è dimostrato incredibilmente versatile, consentendo personalizzazioni avanzate senza sacrificare la stabilità.\n\nNon posso non menzionare l'efficienza energetica di questo processore. Non solo offre prestazioni di altissimo livello, ma lo fa anche con un consumo energetico molto contenuto. Questo si traduce in un sistema più silenzioso e con una minore dispersione di calore.\n\nIn definitiva, il Ryzen 5 5600G è stato il cuore pulsante del mio setup di gioco. Le prestazioni, l'efficienza e l'affidabilità offerte da questo processore sono semplicemente straordinarie. Consiglio vivamente a tutti gli appassionati di gaming di considerare questa meraviglia tecnologica per il proprio sistema. Non ve ne pentirete."

        "review": "Avevo la necessità di aggiornare il mio PC, non tanto per una questione di prestazioni che comunque erano decenti, quanto per una questione di consumi visto che resta acceso 24 ore su 24 in casa e per poter vendere la mia scheda video da gaming che oggi non uso più e che sul mercato ha un ottimo prezzo.\nPartivo da un i7 6700K, con raffreddamento a liquido, ed una GTX 1070. Ci lavoro essenzialmente, ma occasionalmente ci faccio anche fotoritocco. Normalmente lavoro con due monitor, 4k (32 pollici) e tengo aperti parecchi fogli di calcolo oltre che parecchi tab di chrome. Potrebbe sembrare poco, ma l’impegno non è trascurabile né in termini di RAM né in termini di risorse della CPU se si vuole una bella reattività.\nIl mio vecchio PC, anche in Idle alla fine consumava più di 200W, per non parlare del consumo sotto carico e della rumorosità.\n\nIl 5600G è un processore sei core e dodici thread e un'ottima grafica integrata, con 16MB di cache L3 e boost clock di 4.4 GHz. La scheda video integrata è una VEGA7, con sette CU Radeon RX Vega che operano a 1,9 GHz (il 5700G ne ha 8).\nLa cosa interessante è che il consumo massimo di questa CPU è di 65W sotto carico, una bella differenza rispetto al mio PC precedente. Il processore ha anche consumo massimo configurabile tra 65 e 45W, quindi chi vuole limitare ulteriormente i consumi può optare per il limite più basso, perdendo qualcosa in termini di prestazioni.\n\nHo scelto il 5600G rispetto al 5700G perché guardando in rete i benchmark ho visto che a fronte di un prezzo superiore di più del 30% corrisponde negli scenari in cui lo uso io un vantaggio che va dal 5 al 10% in termini di prestazioni. Il 5700 ha 2 core in più e 4 thread, oltre che una VGA VEGA8, ma onestamente se dovessi scegliere per le performance andrei per un processore non G, con scheda video separata.\nQuesto non significa che il 5600 con una VGA dedicata (quando saranno disponibili a prezzi umani un futuro) si comporti male: anche in questo caso la differenza con il 5700 e con i suoi fratelli maggiori senza scheda video non è traumatica.\n\nNota importante, per chi è interessato ad usare SSD di ultima generazione, è che il 5600G ha 24 linee PCIe 3.0 e non 4.0 come le versioni X senza grafica integrata. Se quindi scegliete un SSD compatibile con lo standard PCIe 4.0 non sarete in grado di sfruttarlo anche se la Motherboard è compatibile.\n\nIl precessore è boxato, cioè nella confezione è presenta anche il dissipatore AMD ad aria che funziona molto bene. La cosa in effetti che mi ha sorpreso di più è la silenziosità in condizioni normali di funzionamento… quando mi allontano e ritorno al mio posto, se il monitor è in stand by ho quasi l’impressione che il PC sia spento (se ovviamente lo dotate anche di un buon alimentatore).\nLe temperature si mantengono basse anche con qualche sforzo in più, segno che anche il dissipatore è di buon livello. Ovviamente sotto carico la rumorosità aumenta, anche se non in modo terribile.\nAnche facendo qualche stress test non sono arrivato a superare il 65 gradi, che è una temperatura decisamente buona con un dissipatore stock.\nAggiungo che non è necessario avere pasta termica da applicare: sotto il dissipatore è già presente un piccolo strato preapplicato di pasta per cui basta poggiarlo e serrare i dadi.\n\nIo ho scelto come motherboard una B550, perfetta per questo processore, ed un alimentatore da 550W Corsair Gold che sarà in grado di reggere anche una VGA separata e mi garantisce una buona efficienza sia a bassi che ad altri carichi di lavoro.\n\nIl PC è effettivamente parecchio reattivo e non si impunta mai. La gestione dei due monitor non da nessun problema e tutto sommato anche nel fotoritocco sembra più veloce di prima anche se non monto più la 1070. Che dire, sono soddisfattissimo e lo consiglio.\nSecondo me a questo prezzo difficile trovare di meglio."

It does take some force to plug into the pcie slot. You will know it is in when it snaps into place and the pcie lever is locked and you can't easily pull it out. It does leave very little room if you have a large cpu cooler, but that's the cpu cooler's problem/motherboard layout problem."

It's packaging is very impressive, it comes in a custom box, wrapped very well.\nBased on the size of this card if I ever run out of weight, I'll just bench press this puppy.\nDid I mention It's gigantic!! Lol\nMy last build was over 10 years ago, so imagine the leap I just took.\nI was grimacing a bit over the price, but for a 12gb vid card, let's go!!\nShe is mated to an Asus X570 wifi. I know, I know, should have gotten a better MB, but I was really only planning on doing the MB, mem and HD that failed. Ended up stuffing a 2TB WD SSD, a 2TB platter and some cool corsair memory. Then I decided to get the video card bcoz my old 970 RTX was throwing my board fault beeps. Anyway, just got it up and running. Loving the quickness. Going to load MSFS 2020 and get back to flying to see how she runs. I'm sure it's going to handle it just fine.\nMore later on after I run bench tests. The windows experience score (which yes you still can do on Windows 10) scored me in the high 9's with the exception of the platter even tho she's a 7200rpm gold WD.\nOh well I still like it. Win OS on the platter on a 250gb partition, the master boot record of 100mb the rest wide open. The ssd is wide open. Will run the sim off of it.\nWould definitely recommend it. 👌 good luck with your build. See you online in the skies!"

Mais la carte était enveloppé avec les scellés intact donc neuve et jamais utilisé. L'aspect négatif c'est le site canadien de Gigabytes qui n'est pas en français mais seulement en anglais. Aucun connecteur pour brancher au bloc d'alimentation fournis. Vous devez donc avoir le connecteur requis pour brancher cette carte. Le livret d'instruction est minimal pour expliquer comment brancher la carte graphique. Très silencieuse. Satisfait de mon achat."

This product deserves a solid 5/5 rating due to its impressive power and exceptional visual capabilities.\n\nThe RTX 3060 delivers top-notch gaming performance and stunning graphics, thanks to its 12GB GDRR6 memory and 192-bit interface. It effortlessly handles demanding games and resource-intensive applications, providing smooth gameplay and immersive visual experiences.\n\nThe dual Torx fans on the MSI Ventus 2X 12G OC model ensure efficient cooling and keep the card running at optimal temperatures. This allows for extended gaming sessions without worrying about overheating.\n\nWhile the RTX 3060 may be a bit pricier compared to some budget options, it is well worth the investment for those seeking high-quality graphics and smooth gaming performance. However, if budget constraints are a concern, there are other cost-effective options available that can still deliver satisfactory results.\n\nOverall, the MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 12GB graphics card is a fantastic choice for gamers and PC enthusiasts looking to elevate their gaming experience. Its power, visual prowess, and reliable cooling make it a top-tier option. It's definitely a 4/5 product that has met my expectations in my first PC build."

        "review": "Update: After purchasing 2 more graphics cards, I was able to find the cause of the crashing. I have a Z490 motherboard with an 11th gen Intel CPU. The Z490 boards using the 11th gen Intel CPU have some sort of issue when the PCIe is set to Auto/Gen 4.0 in the BIOS. I set it to gen 3.0 and the issues disappeared on my EVGA 3060. Hope this can help to thers having these issues.\n\nGot the card, started playing and the PC crashed to a black screen. Updating the drivers, purchasing a new power supply did not help. It seems that there is some sort of issue with the power draw of the card, maybe some sort of power spikes during clock boost that cause the motherboard or the power supply to cut power to the card. Researched the internet and came across many others who have various types of RTX30 series card with identical issue and no solution. The overall conclusion is the power issues, even for people with 1500W power supplies. Maybe due to the pandemic strain on the supply the quality of the card significantly dropped and it simply resulted in more bad chips. Maybe it is just an MSI issue, who knows. Returned the card in the end. But this issue aside the card in indeed great when it works."

Not intrusive, but definitely unwelcome. When I play no man's sky, or some newer games, no issues as of yet. Hitman also suffered this issue and crashed a few times.

UNTIL you enable DLSS with framegen or frame generation.\nWith DLSS 3.0 with framegen, you can, in some games, double your FPS. I wouldn't recommend for FPS games because of the added latency and some visual defects that can be caused by generating frames, but for single player games and even some racing sims, this is great!\n\nRTX 3080 at 1440p with quality DLSS2.0 enabled is awesome (I have this card as well) for higher frames when RT is enabled now add to the 60+ FPS you will see with that card, frame generation and a clearer picture and you get about 90+FPS!\n\nFor games like Cyberpunk, The Last of Us and most other new titles that are developed with 10+GB of VRAM in mind the 12GB will get you into 4k gaming and excels at 1440p with high FPS at a fraction of the cost of the previous gen counter part.\n\nComparing it with the 4060, 4060Ti, it is head and shoulders above.\n\nNow, the In to the Spiderverse back plate, Make sure you have a motherboard that has decent space (1/4\") between your CPU cooler(unless you have an AIO and the block isn't huge) and the GPU, because one of the builds i tried this in (MSI prime b560m mobo with a vetroo v5 cooler) is did not fit. If you have a full size ATX mobo you should be fine with clearance.\n\nThe back plate is awesome and so is the box it came in which included a shopping bag, anti-sag bracket, surprise figure and stickers.\n\nGreat purchase at $650 or less.\n\nThe case it is in currently has some of the worst cable management and needs cleaned (Nephews build)."

This card easily and effortlessly does it.\n\nI got this cause it was under $550 and my other card was on the fritz. You can look to YouTube for all the performance specs but for me as I game now, it’s a huge 4 generation upgrade and runs cool and super quiet. I don’t hear any coil whine finally.

        "review": "The Gigabyte RTX 4060 Eagle OC has proven to be the ideal graphics card for my specific case setup. This triple-fan beauty fits perfectly in my micro ATX case and still leaves enough room for my Wi-Fi card, a feat that eluded the larger RTX 3070. While it sports a plastic backplate, it doesn't bother me in the least, and its lightweight design is a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe performance of this card, especially when combined with DLSS3, has left me thoroughly satisfied. While it may not boast the sheer raw power of some other cards, the difference is virtually imperceptible in everyday usage. I had considered the Zotac RTX 4060 Solo as an alternative if the Gigabyte didn't fit, but I'm delighted that it did.\n\nOne noteworthy feature of the Gigabyte RTX 4060 Eagle OC is its silent BIOS switch, which adds to the overall appeal of this graphics card. All in all, it's safe to say that this card has exceeded my expectations and provided a seamless gaming experience within the constraints of my micro ATX case."

The card has a massive fan cooler, which I disassembled in order to put a Bykski water block on it. It took up half the space and fit well within my PC.\n\nWhen hooking up the power cables to it, please do your research and ensure you are doubling up a single line from your PSU. You should have 4 independent cables running to it for sufficient power. Check out on YouTube for videos of mistakes when hooking these up.\n\nThe card barely breaks a sweat temp and processor wise, with regular gaming on high graphics settings. Some games will tax it though, such as MSFS on max settings, but I would expect that of any card.\n\nThe amount of RAM and processing power on this card is significant. So much so, that using a GPU partition software script, I virtually gave half the GPU to a Hyper-V gaming rig inside my gaming rig, so both are now capable of running a game at HD quality (not 4K mind you - that would be asking a lot).\n\nHonestly, I think this card will last me quite a while, my last 1080Ti card ran for 8 years before I replaced it!"

Extremely disappointing as I expected better from ASUS. )\n\nPain in the ass to install. Using the included adapter cable management is really challenging if you have a snug case. You have to be extra careful to install properly as well, or you could risk a melted connection. Once everything is plugged in though, it powered on fine and performance has been through the roof. Too expensive to be honest, but if you want the best performance looks no further."

I didn’t and had to do some slight adjusting of one of my fans that you see vertically since the card was so long and would not slot into my motherboard unless I moved the fan that was in the way by a quarter of an inch.\n\nThe card is very powerful and better at maintaining my fps at 4k resolution on a 55 inch monitor than my 3090FE. Card is also very pretty with the lightning.\n\nI would say my only con is the $2k+ price but that’s just the way of things with these high end gpus where I went with this over the 4090FE since it’s faster and runs cooler."

Came well packaged from amazon with the retail box inside of another box. The retail box was in perfect condition. It replaced a 6900xt and was an upgrade all around except for one minor annoyance.\n\nIt has coil whine. It was incredibly annoying the first 2 weeks and I thought about returning. Worst whine I have ever heard in the ~16 cards I have owned in the last ~20 years. However, through magic or luck I feel like it \"burned in\" and the noise went from OMG WTF is this, to barely distinguishable over my fans running at 50%. I heard a rumor that might happen, so I planned to return before 30 days if it didn't go away. Lucky for me it did.\n\nAlso, I want to emphasize this card is heavy. It comes with an included support that doubles as a screwdriver for the card. Flip it one way it is a screwdriver, other way rubber stopper to hold up card. Pretty nifty design. Has magnet on bottom to stay firmly in place while you position the card. Adjustable scroll wheel to raise or lower the rubber stopper to position. You will need to use the included support or buy a separate one. There is no chance you could use it without a support. Zero.\n\nI am happy with the purchase right now. If I have any issues, I will surely update this review, for $1988 at time of purchase, anything less than working as expected is unacceptable."

For gaming it performs extremely well, only had one issue with the sound cutting out for about 3 seconds. I did once have picture cut out for about 10 seconds, but in hind sight I think Windows was to blame for that one. Hasn't happened since. I've logged a little over 300 hours on games at this point since purchase, so I can safely confirm it does well there. No coil wine/fan noise, even with it being in one of the tiniest cases I know of.\n\nSo, that was for Steam and gaming. The three stars come in with everything else.... Sound cuts out regularly watching Plex, sometimes randomly, mostly in the middle of TV Shows/Movies for 5-10 seconds at a time. No amount of driver tweaks/Adrenaline tweaks/strait up removing Adrenaline worked for me. Swapped cables, messed with BIOS, did everything short of removing the card for its Team Green equivalent. Jellyfin does the same thing, as does YouTube. It appears this card just does not do well with anything else besides gaming. If you Google sound cutting out on AMD GPUs, you'll see its a very common issue with no fix. Effects multiple cards as well.\n\nI'll keep messing with my card to see if I can find the magic settings that allows it to work decently for my use case, but in the meantime at least it runs Starfield and No Mans Sky extremely well.\n\nEDIT: Ended up buying a 4060Ti to replace this card. I'll take most of the blame with this one, I neglected to do my due diligence when it comes to researching AMD and it's poor transcoding support/driver support. Since I missed the return window on this card I'll try and sell it online. Lesson learned!"

That being said I know I'll want to play higher end games and My Nitro's upgraded version comes with the 3060 12 Gb Phoenix a monster of an upgrade at 3x the memory and easily installs with my existing 500 watt Nitro's power supply without that cost coming into factor if i had gone bigger. No I didn't need the 3060 and the 1650 worked perfectly but go big or go home they say so keeping up with the cool kids and wanting the best I could run the Phoenix Asus 3060 12 is a monster a GPU and goes beyond my gaming needs. I am happy and its a quiet card I thought I'd mention since I read others say it was noisy. If I was them I would consider a return under warranty because mine is quiet. I have no complaints and it installed easily and immediately worked perfectly with my 43\" 4k wall mount TV using the HDMI interface. Easy as eating blue berry pie."

(For one example, run KoboldAI on this instead of AIDungeon on Steam.)"

Lo que muchos no te dicen es que es capas de escalar esas resoluciones ya que tiene la potencia necesaria para hacerlo sacrificando un poco los FPS, en mi caso con títulos no competitivos por mencionar algunos como resident evil 3, 4 Remake, Dead by daylight, Ark entre otros, estos títulos los juego entre 40 y 60 fps y son bastante jugables con calidades altas, si estás pensando si se será una buena opción de compra, no lo dudes ya que no te vas a arrepentir, pero si lo que estás buscas son calidades en 4k a 120 FPS todo en ultra está tarjeta no es para ti.\nPor último está tarjeta tiene tecnología como Ray tracing, DLSS y Nvidia Amperece Arch lo que le da un plus a tus videojuegos favoritos, espero que mi pequeña reseña te aya ayudado, saludos 👍"

        "review": "This is a fantastic card when you're looking for high end performance at a decent price, and i use decent price considering current cost for graphic cards. Realistically, this card will probably drop by 100-200 dollars around xmas, especially if the rumored 7950xtx does release around then. But right now, even for the outlandish cost, its the best bang for the buck when looking at high end cards. hands down beats the 4080 in rasterization, but obviously the nvidia 4080 is better at ray tracing, but not by so much that its higher cost makes it worth it imo. Besides, ray tracing, imo, is over rated sure if you sit there and look at a scene in game you can notice a bit better shadow quality, but if your like me and actually play the games and not stare at a single scene then you probably wont notice the visual difference. And the adrenaline software is heads and tails above nvidia's experience software/control panel......and i was using Nvidia cards for the last 7 years and was totally blown away buy the pure performance of this card and the software..no longer is amd hindered by software like so many claim...I'm no fan boy of either brand. I just want best bang for the buck. No question the 4090 is a faster card, but for 8 hundred dollar difference the choice was obvious for me. The only con is that my existing case didn't have good enough airflow to accommodate this card. It runs hot if you don't have a decent case. I 100% recommend the lian-li 216 rgb or standard version for this card...keeps the temps in control and the case looks great and you cannot beat it at its price point..."

Sapphire wants to sell you their generously marked-up Nitro+ cards, and a professional review of the Pulse 7900XTX would see the Pulse cards flying off the shelves instead.\n\nWhile boost clocks are advertised as 2525Mhz, out of the box this card will actually target 3+Ghz under load IF power, voltage and temperature limits allow for it.\n\nDefault fan curve is silent 99.9% of the time, provided you have good airflow in your case. The heatsink on this card is hefty, despite only being 2.5 slot. The card comes with a basic universal anti-sag bracket that is easy to install. I recommend installing it as the card is long and does sag a bit. The bracket comes with longer screws, as regular PCIE screws aren't quite long enough. .\n\nI like that there are 2 HDMI ports and 2 Display ports, allowing for more flexibility of use.\n\nI also like that there is no RGB or lighting of any kind on this card, which means no downloading any bloatware. This card suits my black/white/silver build perfectly.\n\nAs for power draw, I've seen total system power on my UPS getting close to 700 watts in a couple games, and my CPU is just a humble 12600K with a 5Ghz/4Ghz overclock, so I'd recommend a good 1000W power supply to be on the safe side if you're into overclocking at all.\n\nI strongly recommend this card if price is at MSRP (or below in my case)."

It will run everything I throw at it but in many titles I am required to limit frames to 60fps. It's not the card. It's the game engine.\n\nIt becomes clear when you run games like Cyberpunk where stability was a priority. 1440P RT Ultra, the game runs at 80fps. 4K RT overdrive, the game runs at 20fps but it runs.\n\nMost modern games just crash when you exceed 60fps. Some when you exceed 30fps and it's very easy to do on this card even on 4K Ultra."

Good fans.\n\nFinding under power is a pain in the butt, but that's the same with all the 40 series cards. Make sure you have THREE 8 pin connects available on your PSU. It comes with an adapter that ties the power lines into one. I found the adapter long enough that I didn't have any trouble.\n\nAlso, comes with a free floating bracket that you wedge between the card and the case. It's a good inclusion it but I couldn't find a place to mount it that worked with my case and doesn't seem to be necessary.\n\nTons of power, I'm playing RDR2 at 4K Ultra 60 locked, can easily reach past 90 unlocked. Quest 2 Airlink is running at dynamic 90FPS."

        "review": "I'm currently using the card in a Razer Core X eGpu. As expected, performance is not as incredible as many of the games run in 80-100fps in high settings, probably because of the bandwidth issue that many people report thunderbolt 3 has. Still, great performance out of the box and a slight overclock (100mhz core - 400mhz memory, for best stability)\n\nThe card never goes above 300w consumption with my current settings, so I deem the 3 cable unnecessary tbh, I'm spent a couple of days testing with a Y splitter to convert the 3-pin connector to the 2-pin that the Razer Core X has (not sure if this hinders performance but like I said, for me it's fine)\nand there is no signs of overheating on the connectors nor in the cables, because temperature oscillates between 270 celsius and 290 celsius. Transients spikes get to 310w but I don't think they will be a problem since they last for a couple of ms and the PSU is 650w with nothing else taking power from it (except the fan which is like less than 10w consumption).\n\nOverall, card is running great, fits inside the Razer Core X perfectly and there is no signs of overwattage on the cables or the connectors at all, even with this being the OC version and using a Y-splitter from the 16-pin of the card to the 2x8pin from the Razer Core X.\n\nMaybe not worth the 1.2k CAD for running it in a eGpu but hey, the big win about the 40xx over the 30xx is the power consumption, it's much lower and that makes it perfect for the PSU of the Razer Core X, and if I ever decide to build an ITX or a bigger desktop, then I'm covered for the future, so I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nI purchased my Y-splitter from Amazon as well and the one I got is a COMeap GPU VGA PCIe 8 Pin Female to Dual 2x 8 Pin (6+2) male PCI Express Power Adapter Braided Y-Splitter extension cable 9-inch (23cm)"

I look forward to getting a 4K monitor and enjoying some 4K games.\n\nOn a side note\n\nThis gpu was for my first time pc build. I wrote this review to give others information about power supply. I originally paired this gpu with a EVGA 750+ Watt Gold, purchased 2 years ago, to run this build. However the 750 Watts was not adequate for my build. This could be for any number of reasons that I have not confirmed. I upgraded to a 1200 Corsair for upgrading measures. I know it is very overkill. I want to inform other pc buildings that 750 watts power supply may not be enough power. I got my power supply estimated wattage from PC Part Picker. The 750 Watt should have been enough, but the build couldn't run any AAA games until I installed my upgraded power supply. This review is not to bash EVGA by any means. I had a hunch that I would have to upgrade the power supply and that was confirmed by my build running smoothly. My pc build is:\n\n-MSI MAG b550 Tomahawk\n-Zotac RTX 4070 ti OC\n-AMD Ryzen 7 5800X\n\nI hope this is helpful to someone.\n\nJerry"

I am able to easily maintain 240 FPS in almost all AAA games at ultra settings. There are a few resource intensive games where I need to turn down the settings to achieve this goal; however, I am still surprised that I can hit it. I have it paired with an 7800X3D which is also a beast for gaming.\n\nThe GPU I got uses a 3-way adapter (1 end into the GPU, 3 ends which connect to the PSU; see screenshot). For those that get confused by this, you ONLY need to connect 2 ends to the PSU to power this GPU and you can leave the 3rd PCIe pin of the adapter unplugged. If you have enough cables then by all means go ahead and plug it in, but for those that do not, you only need 2 for functionality and sufficient power. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase"

Playing challenging games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Payday 3 makes my 1440p gaming experience way better. The raytracing in the games are perfectly executed especially in Cyberpunk where the shadows are beautiful. It was really a nice thing to see and it maintained a great ~90fps while driving. The graphics are extremely realistic and clear, and the ray tracing capabilities bring these games to life. This graphics card reallty does delivers smooth and engaging gaming.\n\nOne of the best features of the RTX 4070 Ti is its impressive cooling system. I researched extensively on Reddit and other user reviews, and they all suggested the MSI Gaming X Trio. This specific brand and type of GPU is one of the best 4070 TI's you will ever use. Even during extensive gaming sessions, the card runs cool and quiet, ensuring that there's no distracting noise. The build quality is amazing, and the RGB lighting is good if you are into that. MSI has truly outdone themselves with this card, and it's a testament to their commitment to providing gamers with the best possible experience.\n\nAfter using this for a month now, the MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is an absolute powerhouse that has taken my gaming experience to the next level. Whether you're diving into the futuristic world of Cyberpunk 2077 or teaming up with friends in Payday 3, this graphics card delivers outstanding performance, reliability, and aesthetics. If you're serious about gaming and want the best possible graphics, I highly recommend the RTX 4070 Ti. After all, it is an investment that won't make you regret it at all."

However, things took a negative turn when, just 7 days past the return window, the gpu stopped working and started overheating.\n\nGiven that the device was only 37 days old, I was quite disappointed and frustrated with its sudden malfunction. I tried troubleshooting the problem by myself, but all my efforts were in vain. Eventually, I reached out to customer service for assistance but had to wait for a considerable amount of time to get a response being told I can’t return it and to call Asus.\n\nAs for the return policy, I was disappointed that the window had closed before the issue occurred. This added to my frustrations as I'd invested a considerable amount of money in the product, only to have it fail me so soon after purchase. Especially paying for Asus RMA for shipping of another 74 dollars\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this GPU to others due to my personal experience based on amazons and Asus customer service. It may provide satisfactory performance initially, but there appears to be a high risk of malfunction, and the return policy is limited."

        "review": "After having a Gigabyte RTX 3070TI that I overpaid for when it first came out the price tag of a 4080 started to not sound so bad and I'm 100% happy with my decision to upgrade.\n\nAs a guy who cares about tech and graphics but isn't going to sacrifice a limb to get the next best new thing this card has been absolutely fantastic so far. I've had it for about a month now and its been getting a workout playing Cyberpunk 2077 and Diablo 4 in 2k.\n\nPros:\n\nPerformance. Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing overdrive. Need I say more? This card will and should take the vast majority of any games you can throw at it right now maxing out nearly everything even in 4k. If you need more 4090 is always an option but for the price I struggle to think you will find much this card can't do at the moment.\n\nFantastic build quality. This card feels so much better in your hand than my previous gigabyte 3070TI. ASUS TUF continues to impress me in this regard.\n\nEasy install as long as you have the space. You will want to be sure to check your case these 40 series cards are massive.\n\nSuper quiet. I experienced no issues with wine or fan noise from this card even under heavy load its rare I hear it.\n\nGreat cooling. Card was designed with cooling in mind. Unfortunately, it's bigger because of that but the reality is this card just doesn't get hot. At idle mine sits around 30C when under intense load it will sometimes get up in the 60C range, but I have yet to see it get much higher.\n\nCons:\n\nSize won't work for everyone's case. Check it first. I have a Corsair Airflow 4000d and it fits with about .5 inch between the front fans.\n\nPricing is still out of reach for many people. Would be nice to see these cards become more accessible for the average gamer again.\n\nNew cards are power hungry. You will want to use a PSU calculator and be sure your PC is set. There are several solid ones to find with a quick Google search."

        "review": "So you're considering upgrading your GPU. There's plenty of options around, but gosh darn, those prices are steep! Is a modern GPU really worth the expense?\n\nWell, it depends...\n\nIf you're the average computer user and like to watch movies or do some social media posting, with occasional email and web browsing, then no. This GPU is severely overkill. It would be overpriced and you would never utilize the immense list of features and capabilities it offers. Could be more beneficial investing in an Intel GPU if you really want to upgrade your setup and stay ahead of the obsolescence avalanche.\n\nIf you're a gamer, however - or perhaps a video editor, or 3D CGI creator, or Videographer content creator, then this GPU, the ASUS TUF Gaming RTX4080 16GB might be a good fit for you. Yes, it's expensive, but it's a powerful and vastly capable card. As someone who does photo/video/audio restoration and conversion, this GPU runs major circles around my previous GPU (and RTX2060). I can render photo enhancements almost instantly, and render videos in a fraction of the time (especially using nVidia's increasingly popular AV1 codec - exclusive to the 4000 series RTX GPUs).\n\nAnd gaming? Fuggedaboudit...... I can max out every setting in Cyberpunk 2077 @ 4K resolution and this thing eats it up like candy - even in the most graphically demanding areas of the game - and still gets at least 90-100+fps. Same with every other game I've thrown at it so far (not a small list of RTX games, either). Game after game after game, and this GPU never balks. It just powers through each one with flying colors.\n\nSo why not get the RTX4070? None of the 4070 models really push the limits like the 4080. Are they not worth it? By no means - the 4070 cards are also capable GPUs in their own right. They just don't do quite enough, in my opinion, to justify the cost.\n\nWhat about the RTX4090? Quite simply because they don't produce enough power over the 4080 to justify their cost, either. And they suck significantly more power than the 4080 - without significant differences in capabilities.\n\nSimply put, the RTX 4080 - specifically the ASUS TUF Gaming 16GB GPU hits ALL the sweet spots for me. It's just the finest GPU I've ever had the pleasure of owning and using. And if you're a content creator like me, your revenue should easily justify the cost of this beast GPU, considering the amount of time you'll same rendering material.\n\nDo I recommend this GPU? 100%. Buy one before they're all gone - and the prices spike again.\n(Also, I do not work for nor am I sponsored by any company. This is my own personal, honest opinion on this product, as a small business owner and content creator.) Hope the info helps! Happy shopping!"

I decided to spend a little more this time. This card has much better cooling than my zotac 3090 which used more power than this even does. Hottest GPU temp I have ever recorded for this is 62c. It runs 2805+ gpu clock constantly and never ever goes below that with no overclock. I hope asus always keeps this line this good because I never want to buy another brand again."

        "review": "I've tested this GPU well with Blender, benchmarks and some games as well. Despite leaving it rendering large projects and long-running benchmarks (and games too), it doesn't seem to go above 65-66 degrees C, even on the hot day that I've tested it on. The oversized cooler is a bit inconvenient as it covers a few other PCIe connectors, but it wasn't an issue for me with an ATX motherboard and a WiFi NIC on the final PCIe connector.\n\nIt's a bit of a shame that the GPU Tweak III software doesn't work on Linux, but there are alternatives for its more important features. The amount of GPU memory has not been an issue with anything I've tested, even rendering in extremely high resolutions and the ray-tracing boost in performance makes work in Blender possible in the live render view.\n\nIt was definitely possible to make the heatsink thinner without increasing the maximum reached temperature by much. Sound-wise, the fans only start spinning at ~50 degrees C and are very quiet.\n\nAs an added note, when the GPU is connected to power (PSU is providing it power and connected to the wall, even when the PC is off), there is a red light on the GPU which initially seemed like some sort of error indicator, but there's nothing in its manual suggesting that and since the GPU is performing well, I can only guess it is a power indicator. I'm not certain why it was required, but if it bugs you, it's possible to cover that LED with a non-conductive material that blocks light and is not particularly affected by nearby high temperatures (40-50 degrees C)."

I wanted better looking graphics in general, not just higher resolution, so I kept most games at a humble 1080p. Turning up the effects made a little bit of a difference, but not as much as I anticipated.\n\nOverall I would say performance was underwhelming. And 3 fans produce more noise I think than my old card.\n\nI may build a new gaming system this winter, and if I do, I'm going to get a better card than this.\n\nThat having been said, the card was plug and play, since I already had nvidia drivers everything \"just worked\". This is a large card, though, barely fits in my ATX case. It should be within specs, but you may want to measure to make sure it will fit in your preferred PCIe slot before purchasing."

I can play all my games at 4k 120 fps ultra settings, and when some of the more demanding games began to struggle with hitting 120 fps (usually due to ray tracing), frame generation helped brings frames back up.\n\nWhen you compare it to the RTX 3090ti, it is actually a good deal in my opinion, as the performance boost in both rasterization and ray tracing is noticeable and it was only $300 more expensive when I purchased it. Frame generation and DLSS are a game changer for getting high refresh rates out of demanding games.\n\nThat being said, if you don't care about playing games at ultra graphics with ray tracing enabled at 4k and high refresh rates, then this card is overkill and you'd be better off getting a 3000 series card. If that is what you're looking for though, you will certainly not be disappointed. It has yet to let me down, even when I do some light overclocking."

I gave up on a 4090 due to the outrageous prices; a 4080 seemed like a good compromise between price and performance. Ran the Unigine 2 benchmark at 1080p setting and it achieved a top 300 score without breaking a sweat. See photos. Temperature never exceeded 65C and the fans never got past 40% during the test. That’s astonishing for what’s supposed to be a “bargain” RTX 4080. I also love the fact that this card isn’t laughably huge like most other 4080’s; this thing slipped easily into my mid-ATX chassis with no problem at all. Oh, I almost forgot, this card is downright quiet compared to every other graphics card I’ve ever owned. I had to use my Craftsman inspection mirror to look at the fans to confirm that they were spinning because I could not hear any fan noise even with the card under full load. Performance is outstanding and easily beats my Gigabyte 3080 Vision OC by 40-50%. My MSI 4080 Ventus clocked up to 2835 MHz right out of the box; I haven’t even bothered to overclock it yet because frankly there’s no reason to do so. I certainly don’t need any more performance from it. So far I’ve played Fallout 4 (heavily modded) and some Meta Quest 2 VR games and this card just tore through them all. I also love the look of this card; it’s far better looking than most other 4080s imho even without RGB. If you’re still on the fence about buying a 4080, I strongly recommend that you consider this MSI 4080 Ventus 3X OC. It’s a strong performer, it’s cheaper than most other 4080s, it runs quiet and cool, and it doesn’t look gaudy or ridiculous like most other RTX 4080 cards do. And it’s likely one of the few 4080s that will actually fit in your case without the need for major hacksaw surgery lol."

Capite bene, che per chi come me tende a non cambiare scheda video molto spesso, acquistare una scheda che ora funziona benissimo in 2k e domina il 1080p, anche fra qualche anno non avrà problemi a reggere giochi in qualità alta o massima.\n\n-PRESTAZIONI E TEMPERATURE, CONSUMI\nHo effettuato diversi benchmark, oltre a provare diversi giochi, e in 1080 la media è sempre bloccata sopra 130-150 fps a qualità massima. Per quanto riguarda le temperature xfx in generale fa ottime custom, di fatto le temperature rimangono piuttosto buone, oscillazione tra i 40 gradi in idle e i 50 max 55 gradi in sessioni di gioco prolungate. Anche i consumi di questa scheda sono più che buoni, in genere rimangono sotto i 150watt e nei casi più estremi sotto i 200watt.\n\n-STILE\nLo stile di questa custom in particolare SWFT è semplice, ma elegante. Non dispone di rgb o testi colorati, ma di fatto sono una cosa secondaria tenendo conto del prezzo. Questo non sapevo se metterlo nei pro o i contro poichè dipende dai gusti personali. In ogni caso nonostante la sua semplicità, all'interno del pc fa la sua figura. Se volete anche gli rgb e loghi colorati dovreste spostarvi sulla fascia successiva di xfx ad esempio QICK e MERC, solo che in quel caso al prezzo che costano potete comprare una rx6800xt, quindi non so effettivamente quanto conviene.\n\n-BUNDLE AMD\nAttualmente questo venditore e questa scheda aderiscono al bundle AMD per ricevere una key gratuita di STARFIELD premium edition.\n\nVENDITORE/SPEDIZIONI:\nIl venditore è cordiale, e la spedizione abbastanza veloce, ho ordinato la scheda il 13 agosto ed è arrivata il 18 agosto. Lo scatolo è arrivato quasi intatto, tranne una piccola ammaccatura nella zona superiore, ma immagino sia stata colpa del corriere. Immagini allegate.\n\nCONTRO:\nLUNGHEZZA:\nLa scheda risulta comunque molto lunga, intorno ai 34cm, nel mio caso ho avuto qualche difficoltà a farla entrare nel case, ma niente di eccessivo. Quindi prima di acquistarla assicuratevi che vi entri nel case.\n\n-RAY TRACING E OTTIMIZZAZIONE SOFTWARE:\nPurtroppo questa è una nota dolente di amd, con il ray-tracing attivato la scheda va decentemente, ma niente di eccezionale, AMD FSR funziona abbastanza bene, ma comunque non è all'altezza del DLSS.\nPurtroppo se vi interessano queste tecnologie amd non è la scelta che fa per voi.\n\nCONCLUSIONI QUALITA'/PREZZO:\nGlobalmente la rx6800 si presenta come un ottima scheda, il prezzo a cui l'ho acquistata è di 459 euro ed attualmente è un best buy su questa fascia di prezzo. Tenendo conto che fa di media dai 20-50 fps in più rispetto alla RTX 4060TI da 16GB su quasi la stragrande maggioranza dei giochi, e con un prezzo di circa 100 euro in meno. Quindi questa scheda è ottima per chi vuole giocare senza compromessi da oggi fino ai prossimi anni, rinunciando però a volte al ray-tracing e a qualche ottimizzazione software."

And a very good price compared to it's NVidia alternatives in the same performance bracket. First time moving over to AMD after being NVidia since I started building PC's almost 12 years ago. And I have to say it's been a breath of fresh air. The card performs brilliantly.\n\nNow onto the seller. I was worried at first as they are outside the UK, based in Portugal I believe. But the card arrived within the expected delivery time, and the support team have been fantastic in helping me claim my Starfield Code via the \"AMD Raise the Game\" promotion, which this seller is taking part in. So they have just provided me with the Premium Edition of Starfield for purchasing a qualifying graphics card. (Please check promotion is still running before purchasing if this is important for you). But as I say, fantastic seller and will definitely use them going forward too."

In the past I've had 1660 super, 2060S, and 3060ti. 3060ti was great but after I started seeing games lagging and failing when graphics turned way up, I figured what the hell. For $1100 used I genuinely feel like this is a deal. I don't feel cheated. The graphics are amazing. You can turn everything up to as high as graphics settings in game will go this thing will handle it and laugh. Cyber punk, no problem. I hope they go beyond Physco Ray tracing settings in the future. The only knock I'll give this thing if you game on it for hours @ max settings eventually you will hear the fans roaring pretty loud. Then go down, and eventually roar again sometime later. I really don't care about loud fans though. It's not like it overpowers the TV. When at idle/not gaming you definitely will not hear the fans ever. 10/10 great GPU it's like every GPU I've had in the past was only pretending to be this thing."

My uses (as it pertains specifically to the GPU) are personal / non professional. I use a LG 34 ultrawide 3880x1440 @ 144hz as main display (although this unit does drive my 2560x1444@144hz display as well (and occasionally a cheapy 1080 TV for youtube)\n\nMy concerns going into the purchase were power consumption (and the resultant waste heat in a climate / housing situation that necessitates air conditioning) as well as the size and potential noise.\n\nThe thing is absolutely massive. Its 7mm longer than my Fractal Define XL R2 case- which natively supports a 330mm card without removing the HD chassis. So, after discarding the HD chassis I was able to fit this 337mm card (admittedly with about 145mm to spare)\n\nIts big, its heavy, its substantive. you absolutely will be accounting for the size- in more ways than one. The size allows for larger heat sinks and the triple fan design, so its not entirely (or at all) a drawback if you can accommodate it.\n\nI undervolted my card and can run modern games fully maxed without going above 60c- usually substantially lower. In most cases, even after longer sessions, I don't see temperatures past the 40s. My case a good amount of airflow, though, so its fairly adept at ditching the heat, especially given the engineering of the cooling for the GPU.\n\nthe card idles and handles light gaming tasks at 29-30C, lol. although its rated for 320w i dont think ive seen it grab more than 250 or so while gaming. its definitely interesting to watch the power use change in real time, even from level to level in a game, depending on optimization and whats going on around it, but the performance itself has never dropped- it just uses more gas.\n\noverall i'm pleasantly surprised by what i was able to achieve in both a power use as well as cooling. its not necessarily amazing to have a \"cold\" GPU when idling, but it runs colder than my triple fan EVGA 1080ti does both under load and while just hanging out\n\nit really is huge compared to older gen cards- even the larger ones. but, all the dimensions of both your case and the card are available to view before you make any decisions. if youre cocky about your case like i was, it may still be worth double checking if youll have to remove any cages or rearrange things though- my case is likely in the top 95th percentile for consumer case sizes and i still had to make adjustments.\n\nI paired this with a 1kW PSU coming from a 750w, and i can say thats overkill for the setup. 850 would have been fine, even paired with my RAM/CPU combo- the latter of which also undervolted quite nicely."

Great value and performance for the money.\n\nWas concerned about the size but it fit in my sons standard case with no issues."

        "review": "Amazing GPU.\n\nCustom cooler shows much attention to detail. This GPU looks as almost as expensive as it costs which is very rare these days. The LED light bars look great (both top and bottom), and I don't even like LEDs. I like you can run an ARGB cable from the GPU itself to your motherboard to sync up the GPU with colors with the rest of your rig if desired. The bars cast a nice soft diffused glow that runs the stretch of the card (top and bottom) . Looks aside (very impressive), If you look at all pros/con's and factor in the extra cost for the custom design, this model is a clear cut above the rest of the older and reused/adapted HS designs from past generations. This is one of those GPU's that you can run at 420W (stock OC), and it shrugs it off the heat and noise like its nothing. The only other model that comes close is the Asus TuF, but it uses a tired looking military design where the Sapphire Nitro looks like someone actually put effort into not only the appearance, but the vapor chamber cooling keeps hotspot temps under 80C (hit 78 on stock, 75 on secondary bios.\n\nThe card is very quiet and has just a tad of coil whine on an open bench.\n\nWhen placed in a case the mild coil whine quickly fades. Setting to the second bios saves about 40W which may not seem like much, but it reduced temps and fan speeds even lower, and surprisingly without noticeable performance loss.\n\nNice thing about this card is you can use Sapphire Trixx software to flip between BIOS's, no need to crack open the case with a flashlight to flip a dip switch. I'd recommend the second bios as a starting point, and then work on an undervolt to bring power down to almost Geforce 4000 series power efficiency. I'm still tweaking but its looking like 350-375 total wattage is possible after undervolting, but YMMV (silicon lottery).\n\nWhat else separates this from the \"Competition\"?\n\nDual HDMI 2.1a for 8K 60Hz support, plus two Displayport that pushes into to 50GB/s territory ensure no upgrade will be necessary for a long while (24GB of GDDR6 will help with longevity as well).\n\nGiven the competition, for pure rasterized performance you can't beat the 7900 XTX (skip the XT unless it's at least 25% less) with anything but a 4090. The 4090 cost twice the price so not really a comparison. Even then, the 7900 XTX nips st the heels or even surprisingly beats the 4090 (Call of Duty) although that's rare.\n\nLastly, while RDNA 3.0 is not an RT monster, the RT capabilities are sufficient enough to handle many/most games at 1440P without killing performance or IQ. 1440P Ultra with RT above 60 FPS is common on AAA games. It compares to roughly 3090 Ti speeds so far in my testing for typical RT games, but falls behind the 4080/90 by 20-50% (more for path traced games of which there are only two). That being said, matching, or even besting Nvidia's 3000 series was a nice surprise I didn't expect given all the negatively around RT.\n\nAll this being said, RT is still largely gimmicky where games have to exaggerate the effects to even be noticeable, and that's why RT is often the first thing disabled to claw back performance. Upscaling helps but ruins IQ while in motion (on both sides).\n\nSad reality is that even the mighty 4090 is too slow for RT (path tracing) without the use of image downgrading technology like DLSS at 4K. At 1440P you can \"experience\" path tracing but the GPU even at $2500 CAD is not capable of delivering a anything special.\n\nRT will shine one day, today is not the day though (we need at least 3-4x the 4090 RT performance to have high refresh with RT enabled), so this is a long way of saying RT is good enough on the 7900 XTX, but suffers horribly for fully path traced games (as do Nvidia cards) although driver improvements have allowed for 1440P Quake 2 path traced above 60FPS at ultra details.\n\nTldr; buy it if you want the best performance per dollar high performing GPU that doesn't look like they adapted some old design on to cheap. It beats the 4080 by around 5-10% (possibly larger in the future as 4080 maxes out at 16GB), and nips at the heels of the 4090 (especially at 1440P).\n\nYou can gain an additional 5-10% performance if overclocking but the extra power needed to drive RDNA past 3Ghz isn't really worth it IMHO."

Ray tracing is nice and I have hit really high frame rates for demanding games, while also having low GPU temps.\n\nThe sapphire make, in particular, goes well with any rgb set-up. It also has three cable slots that I managed to slide through that open gap at the end of the card to make it slightly more tidy looking.\n\nHighly recommended."

        "review": "This is a pretty good card, especially considering I upgraded from a 1070 to this. The difference is night and day, for sure. I run triple Display Port monitors at 144hz, 2k and this thing is under barely any load, and runs at low temps (can't remember the temps off the top of my head, but I'll update this when I check it out later). For someone who wears headphones, this card is a great deal.\n\nThere are two cons that I've come across, and I have a feeling they're both on the QC side of the house. When initially installing it, I thought it was fully seated, but when I powered it up, it would power cycle itself. I put my 1070 in and it worked just fine, so I knew the problem was this card. After looking it over, I noticed the \"tab\" end of the bracket was bent, so I straightened it out and it now works just fine. The card did seem well-packaged, and the big box the whole order came in wasn't damaged, so the bracket must've been bent at the factory. I'm assuming these are mass-tested in open air systems, so the bent tabs wouldn't have been noticed; otherwise the only explanation is someone in QC knew it was bent and shipped it anyways.\n\nAfter getting it running, I noticed that the fans make a pretty annoying amount of coil whine. I know for sure it's these fans because I ran the system using Intel's on-chip graphics, and then the 1070, and never heard any fan noise. But after running this for a few hours, the noise was annoying enough that I'm actually sending the card back and going with a different brand. I didn't notice the whine when I had music playing, but I am often in meetings or classes where I don't wear headphones, and there's no way I'd be able to focus with this sound in my head. I only docked one star because, again, the noise isn't ear-piercing or anything, so it may be a non-issue for someone else's environment."

        "review": "This model has received a lot of hate for not being enough of an upgrade over the 3060ti to justify purchase. Some tests actually show it to be a slight downgrade. I'm coming from a 1660 however so the performance is great by comparison and opted for this over a plain 4060 for a bit of extra performance.\n\nThis may not quite be the solution if you are looking to play modern games at 4K, which was the source of much of the disappointment, but works very well at 1440p. I've mostly used it for flight games like DFS and it keeps a steady 60fps at high settings and that resolution.\n\nOne underrated aspect is how quiet this thing is. In fact, for many normal tasks while not gaming, the fan doesn't even turn on. At first I thought mine was defective and was going to melt, but turns out passive cooling is back in style to some extent. The fan remains reasonably quiet under load. The power usage is also low if that matters to you.\n\nOverall I have no regrets on this one though I understand how hard core gamers upgrading from the 3000 series are mad. I'd go for this one over an equivalent 3000 series at the same price for what it's worth."

        "review": "To preface:\nI am not one who will EVER go all out on the max GPU to max every setting on the latest triple A title - i want my stuff to last a long time (I've never had a GPU, CPU, RAM or PSU burn out in over 30 years - my 486 still works btw)\nI am more concerned with steady FPS that ZOMGMAXULTRA settings.\nBought this 8GB RTX 4060Ti to go with my new i9-12900K\n\nThat being said:\n\nSOOOOO much negativity on this card out there - near impossible to find good reviews on this card.\nEveryone is hung on the price point and the only 8GB of VRAM and its performance vs the 3060TI.\n\nGetting negatives out of the way:\nFor $400 on a next gen GPU, no it does not deliver in terms of that fully.\nLess memory bus, still only 8GB of VRAM, the same DDR as previous gen at that.\nfor a little more money - you can get the RTX4070 for better performance overall and maybe more future proof - but again, its more money (at least $200 more).\nFor about the same, you can get a more buffed last gen card and maybe even get a higher tier of 30 series.\nFor a little less you can get an AMD card for about the same performance.\nYes, they released a 16Gb version for $100 more, but that's got issues of its own in terms of useable memory and none of their partners want to sell it because of bad press.\n\nThere are positives though (yes I have some buyer's remorse, but its subsiding as I use it more):\n\n1. It draws a LOT less power than 4070/80/90 cards. This is important to me as it produces a lot less heat.\n(Mine stays under 70C under load with stock fans on card). Only takes 1 8pin PCI-E supply.\n2. it DOES have DLSS3, which is amazing for games that support it -in some cases giving you double the FPS. Boosts me from 60FPS to almost 100 in Cyberpunk 2077 at a mix of high and ultra settings @2550 res. D4 also performing about the same.\n3. Raytracing is an added bonus. Improves many lighting details to make graphics pop even more @ 2550\n4. Form factor is smaller than 3 fan versions, no space issues in case (iCue 4000X). It also has one less power cable running to it as it only needs 1 8pin supply.\n\nWhile i wish this had at least 10 or 12GB of VRAM (much less the 16 it should have come with), it is what it is and it is performing better than the 1660 Super i replaced.\n\nif you wanting max/ultra settings on current day games - skip this.\n\nIt you are wanting to upgrade/build now and have the $400 AND aren't obessed with top tier graphics @4K and 400FPS (which you aren't if you are looking at this level of card), I'd say get this and forget the haters.\nIf you can wait, I'd wait to see how the rest of 2023 shakes out and prices settle.\nI think I might be regretting it when new titles come out and 8GB isn't enough, but its working better than expected from reviews from my experience so far.\n\nHappy gaming!\n\n**\nUpdate: After owning this and running it for about 2 weeks now, I have no regrets. It stays cool under load, even at higher settings even at 1440. Cyberpunk is running 120fps (with DLSS3 on), with ultra RT and many of the settings turned to high - never tops 60C, VRAM is capped, fans don't go over 50%. D4 (while less graphics intense) is go. Handles current FPS games without issue as well.\nNo idea how it will handle Starfield/Hogwarts/Last of Us, but Its not a 4080/4090, so I am very pleased with the consistent fps and quality and non-strain on the Wattage or Temps.\n\nVery pleased"

La tarjeta depende mucho del DLSS 3 un ejemplo es Plague Tale el cual va a unos 65~fps en ultra y el DLSS crea artefactos raros al mover la cámara por el desenfoque de movimiento, claro, puedes habilitarle algunos truquitos y va a mejorar considerablemente, pero hacer esto con cada juego es algo bastante tardado y sin sentido, sabiendo que es una tarjeta nueva.\nSin embargo creo que si le ha caído mucho hate, la tarjeta para mi monitor de 75hz y 1080 es perfecta, saca buenos fps en competitivos y para edición en blender photoshop y davinci va fluida, ( A 1080, en 4k se le dificulta un poco), consume poca energía y en cada actualización mejora más la estabilidad del sistema y de los juegos, Ej fornite que me iba terrible cuando recién la instalé y ahora corre 75 fps estables con RT y todo en épico, llevo mes y medio con esta tarjeta, digamos que pasa raspando por \"una buena compra\".\n\nRyzen 5 5600x\n32GB 3200mhz RAM\n2 M.2 5000~ Mb/s 3TB\n550w\nWin11"

I wish it had at least a 160bit bus and 10GB of VRAM but it is what it is... in Cyberpunk running DLSS 3 and Frame Gen you can easily get over 100fps at 1440p it has lower power draw and this is a very decent and stylish cooler model. It's definitely worth the upgrade if you prefer Nvidia and you have an older card like the 3060 or 20 series or lower... if you have a 3060 ti or higher just undervolt and stick with your card until something better comes along...\n\nOverall I like this card a lot and it has great performance at 1080p and 1440p and would recommend."

If you're not looking exclusively at 4k120 or don't want to spend the extra hundreds of dollars on a 4090, it's the best way to go.\n\nI upgraded from a 3080 10gb, and the performance increase was dramatic in everything. The card is also extremely quiet; it doesn't even have to turn on the fans if you aren't gaming, and even with some older games it doesn't get hot enough to rev the cooling enough to be heard. It's sitting at 37c with the fans off as I type this, and it's fairly warm in the room I'm in.\n\nPerformance-wise, you also can't go wrong here. It can handle 4k60 easily, if you want it for that; I have a higher refresh-rate 1440p monitor, and it can normally handle even the most demanding games out there at 100+fps with everything turned up. Cyberpunk 2.0/Phantom Liberty plays perfectly at 1440p Ultra with Path Tracing enabled, as an example. Starfield plays with no problems at all, Remnant 2 was pushing my monitor's refresh at 160fps at 1440p Ultra with DLSS Quality+Framegen. There really hasn't been anything I could throw at it that it couldn't handle, or that justified paying more for a 4090 on my setup. It's a great card, I just hope with the 5000 series Nvidia finds a way to make them a little more reasonably priced."

My current system has a 5800x3d cpu with a 750 watt psu and it runs great. Quiet and cool. I have a large case and a Scythe Fuma 2 cpu cooler and have yet to hear any fan noise. I left it on default which is quiet mode. Performance mode just makes the card loud for a few percent increase in frames. Not worth it. My system would not handle a 4090 and upgrading everything so it could would cost me more in additional funds than the price of the 4080 alone so it made perfect sense to me. I am not a fan of rainbow led unicorn vomit so I installed Asus Armory Crate and made the logo a static color. The logo is the only led and default is unicorn vomit. You can also unplug the led connector on the board to permanently turn off the led. I like the static color as I can only tell my PC is on if I see the logo light on. My room is on the ocean so I have ambient sound of waves crashing so in a perfectly silent room you might hear it. My internet was out when the package arrived and I had to wait for it to come back on before I could install the drivers from Nvidia. Keep that in mind as no software comes with it. My monitor is an Odyssey G9 49\" 240hz and games look mind blowing on it. Almost like controlling the actors in a movie. If you have anything less than a 3090 ftw I would highly recommend this card. The 4070 ti is something I considered but at my resolution I would have to turn the settings down so I skipped it. DLSS 3 seems to work well and I am using raytracing for shadows and lighting when available on games. If you are on the fence get off it and get one of theae today."

        "review": "If you're here, you probably already know precisely what the 4090 is and does. Key takeaways for this TUF variant are that it performs as advertised, is very large and runs relatively cool. Replaced a 10GB 3080, hesitantly, to take full advantage of the 5k+ resolution of a new VR headset. The 3080 just didn't have the stomach for those resolutions. This card pushes 3300x3300 (per eye!) without breaking a sweat in the racing sims and roomscale experiences I've thrown at it. It's almost comical just how much memory and how powerful this GPU has and is.\n\nThings to be aware of:\n- Power requirement. You need 600W dedicated purely to this card if you want to make full use of its potential. That includes 4 SEPARATE dedicated 8-pin PCIe connectors running from your ATX 2.0 PSU's VGA/PCIe/CPU outputs to the 12VHPWR connector that comes with the card. Alternatively, newer ATX 3.0 PSUs come with the 12VHPWR standard, I believe. I went ahead and upgraded to a 1000w gold PSU. 850w minimum spec made me nervous with OC'd CPU and all other cards/USB devices considered.\n- It's huge. It's \"check your available internal case dimensions\" levels of huge. Specifically length and height (amount of PCIe slots) are the likely largest concerns, but if you have a slim case, you need to check that too.\n- It's heavy. Thankfully it comes with a support that works very well. Once in place, there is no concern about the load being put on the PCIe slot.\n- It can get noisy when hot enough for the fans to start ramping up. There is definitely a little coil whine, but I run my case fans relatively high to begin with and am not noticing it any more than I did with my TUF 3080. Those who like dead-silent systems may want to look elsewhere, but I really think the issue is overblown unless my experience is the exception.\n- It runs surprisingly cool, even with low fan speed. My case is not spacious, but I have not seen a rise in CPU, motherboard or RAM temps compared to having the 3080 in there.\n- It can easily outpace single-core performance on a majority of CPUs out there. Beware that any CPU bottlenecks will become immediately evident. I've noticed walls that didn't exist before since the GPU can now handle all display demands at 60% power when unoptimized/single-core heavy sims hit the wall with my aging 10700k at 5ghz.\n\nI feel a bit ridiculous being a proponent of an $1,800 GPU, but times have changed. 5k+ resolution HMDs now exist. Triple screen 4k performance is a real thing for others. I would not consider buying this GPU if it weren't for a very specific need of mine, but it's good to know that GPU performance will never be a concern in the foreseeable future and I can focus on eventually updating to a new socket, CPU and DDR5 when it becomes necessary."

Because of the metal slot on this board, GPU does not sag at all even though it's quite heavy, once the slot part is screwed in.\n\nGot around 34,700 in cinebench 2024 gpu test. More than double my old 3080's 14,400.\nOnly using 3 PCI-E 8 pin connectors, card only drew 260 watts max in cinebench 2024 gpu test, 3 connectors gets you 450 watts. 4 pins gets you 600 watts and is only needed for (extreme?) overclocking.\n\nPaired with a 13900KS, it got 90 fps in starfield in the cities, 1440p ultra no downscaling/fsr, depending on area. I thought I was happy with my 55 fps I was getting on my old 3080, the experience was miles better getting 90 fps in the cities. This gpu gets around 150 fps in interiors.\n\nGreat card I would recommend it. I gave it 5 stars, except 4/5 on price, 1700 is a bit much, but if you can afford it and gaming is your passion, I would definitely get it."

When I first installed the card, it was really hissing during DOOM Eternal, but then summer hit and my AC easily drowned out any PC noise.\n\nFast-forward to now, the fall, and even during Blender renders (during which the rapid power oscillation tend to make all cards scream), the TUF 4090 is no louder than my EVGA 3070 Ti (which was a very quiet card in my experience).\n\nI would NOT rely on a card's coil whine \"getting better\" - from my understanding that should not happen and doesn't really make any sense, but... anecdotally, that's what happened to me.

It's going to sound stupid, but basically since Skyrim was released my go to metric for raw performance has been can it run ultra-modded Skyrim smoothly (\"ultra-modded\" has changed a lot over the years so the metric stayed relevant for me). Yes Skyrim is a 12 year old game, but when you get enough texture mods combined with an ENB and such it can be quite demanding. With my standard ultra-modded install I was getting like 40fps fairly consistently on the 1080ti but there were still dips in certain areas, this card is locked at a rock solid 60fps (capped due to engine limitations) and it's barely breaking a sweat, highest usage I saw was 51% usage in the most demanding spot I know to test ingame (would occasionally cause a crash even on the 1080ti and the 1080ti was constantly pinned at 100% usage). I swear I've never had such a jump in performance from a single upgrade, granted I skipped 2 generations this time, but even still. Time to go do an obligatory Cyberpunk playthrough with settings cranked I guess. To be clear I bought this card specifically for its AI performance and VRAM for locally running large language models and stable diffusion, but now I'm geeking out over the raw speed of this card so I guess some gaming is in order.\n\nSpecifically regarding the ASUS TUF branding, it's a solid well built card. The metal shroud gives the card a lot of rigidity and the recessed 12vhpwr plug is nice for helping to avoid putting strain on the connector which has been a problem with other cards. This card is absolutely massive, so build accordingly. Their little support bracket to keep the card from sagging is a high quality machined aluminum part (although it barely fit above the tower basement in my Enthoo Evolv case even at its lowest setting). Thermals have been good so far, haven't seen it top 70 C yet at stock speeds. At stock the card pulls about 500W peak so make sure you have a beefy PSU.\n\nI'll be the first to say that if you're running a 1440p monitor (or lower) this card is absolutely overkill (probably my next upgrade) for gaming in basically any title, if you know you need this power for something specific, pick it up, but if not there are much better price/performance options."

Went on a hot streak and took home like $200. 4090 Suprim X order placed. It's not going to show up for a few weeks. Hmm, I'm bored. Maybe I'll gamble some more and win enough for Hogwarts Legacy. Ended up losing the original $200 I made and a couple hundred more. Suprim X order canceled.\n\nYeah, that was a crappy ride. But I was determined to buy myself a 4090 even if it meant being in the poor house for the foreseeable future. Luckily the budget Gaming X Trio came back in stock.\n\nSure, everything's a little crappier compared to the Suprim X, but this card is no slouch.\n\nMy card is hardly a silicon lottery winner, but even with a mild overlock, I'm rocking games like Dead Space (2023) at 4K ultra settings w/ ray tracing at 100+ FPS. DLSS 3.0 is an absolute game changer and it's a darn shame it's only going to be available for 40XX series cards.\n\nHas some screeching coil wine when running demanding benchmarks, but when playing actual games with the sound turned up, it's imperceptible to the ear.\n\nThis card is definitely a chonker. In the past year, I've gone from a \"tiny\" two-fan, single slot 1080 TI to a formidable 6800 XT to the almost comically large triple-slot behemoth. The crazy thing is this is actually quite a bit smaller than other 4090 models, some of which take up an absurd four slots on your case.\n\nNot sure how true this is, but I've read it from multiple sources over the past month or so that the 4090 series were originally supposed to have much higher power draw (and thus heat), which explains why each one has such a major focus on cooling. That ends up working in our favor since the 4090 line is \"over engineered\" to the point where overheating should not be an issue at all. Running benchmarks, my GPU never reaches 70F. The base, non-4K Timespy doesn't even get this card to 60F. And my case fans are just your run of the mill fans in a standard setup. Nothing special at all.\n\nThe only times this card was pushed to the limit was when I was maxing out the most demanding games at 4K ultra w/ ray tracing, like Portal RTX or The Witcher 3 with the next gen update.\n\nWhile gaming at 4K is fun, I also have a 27\" 165Hz 1440p monitor. This is perfect for when I just want to go nuts with settings and still get insane frame rates (like 180 fps in Red Dead Redemption 2). Honestly, this might be the end-game 1440p card. You might think the 4090 is overkill for 1440p, but as games get more demanding, it should settle in nicely. I bet you could game at 1440p max settings for the next decade or so with this bad boy.\n\nWhen I moved from the 6800XT, it kind of scared me. I never wanted to be the type of person who felt the need to upgrade every generation. I liked buying a top of the line GPU and then just playing the hell out of it for five years or so before upgrading. But now that the 4090 is in my possession (and I have a gambling addiction I apparently need addressed), I don't plan on upgrading any time soon. In fact, I'm going to unsub from the r/buildapcsales subreddit to avoid all temptation and just enjoy my games in peace."

        "review": "This is probably the one you want for 4k 144hz gaming. Performance is incredible even on a last gen platform (5950x/DDR4 3600 CL 18). Fan noise and temperatures are low while gaming once you dial in a fan curve you like. It's somewhat cheaper than other premium models too, though not by much. Only two problems. Under heavy load it has some coil whine which can get pretty bad. You may find yourself capping the framerate, lowering settings, or using upscaling to reduce load, which in many games you should not have to do with a GPU this powerful.\n\nFor immersive gaming it's fine to cap the framerate, but if you want to play fast games at 165hz or more you might be screwed, it can get like a banshee at 240hz. But you also might not mind because those games are loud anyway and you will probably have headphones. Coil whine is also supposed to lessen over time but I have my doubts it will.\n\nIf you want to play games at 4k at over 144hz you will need to use display stream compression because Nvidia is dumb won't equip the gpu with the latest display port gear. At super high refresh rate DSC might not be that noticeable though, though the coil whine will be.\n\nFor the price this graphics card runs at the aesthetic is hugely underwhelming. It is clean, which is nice, but boring. For close to 2k dollars I want my graphics card to either be very pretty with no RGB like ASUS Pro Art cards, or very pretty with RGB like the Suprim X from MSI. Instead what we get is very utilitarian and basic. I think I recommend mounting this card vertically if your case has room for that, because the LEDs on the fan side are the most attractive.\n\nAlso don't waste your time trying to get dragon center to work with this card. Use MSI center instead."

        "review": "Why did I settle on the 4070? Because at the price point and feature set when I purchased it (Early September '23) it was the best current and future gaming card for my budget for a 1080P gamer looking to eventually move up to 1440 or higher without breaking the bank. The AMD equivalent for the current gen came out right around when I purchased it, but DLSS and RT cores will give it a significantly longer lifespan, so I have no regrets. Should I have waited a month? Probably, but I needed a GPU at the time.\n\nWhy MSI? It has been over 15 years since I built my last PC, and there have been a few solid and consistent brands. MSI has always been there on price and performance, and since I was already going with an MSI motherboard, I figured I'd match them. I wanted a 3 fan GPU as well for noise as well as possible overclocking reasons. I also liked this card's lack of RGB.\n\nThe results? This card has been impressive, and made me rethink what I wanted to do with the card. Stock, it performs well, near an average 4070 (Well within margin of error), perhaps slightly better due to it's very modest overclock. But what impressed me more was the temperatures, being able to run torture tests and struggle to get the card over 60C. The 4070 is an incredibly efficient GPU, and there's still room on the table. I was able to mostly stably OC it at +225 MHZ and around +1500 HMZ on the ram, but I found I got nearly identical performance at +150 and +1000 respectively. Tempuratures nearly identical, with maybe the chip getting up to 62 or 63 on the extreme end of the OC, with them going down to 61ish for the OC I settled on. However, the performance improvement was not particularly large, maybe 3-5%. So, instead, I decided to try undervolting the GPU. I was able to run the GPU very stably undervolted around .05v at around +100ish core speed and +1000 on the memory, while reducing the tempuratures slightly, and almost entirely avoiding the max power draw of the card (which is 200w in this single connector model). I could probably do a more agressively undervolt the card at more stock speeds and cut the draw to about 150W under torture loads if I wanted to. Now, thermals are still around 60C here, but the reduced wattage under load keeps the chip better longer, and puts less wear on other components.\n\nNow, with all that OC testing out of the way, this GPU even at stock or underclocked speeds chews though anything I throw at it. It's currently overkill for 1080P, but it tests well even at 1440P. The fact that the fans rarely ramp up over 30% speed also means this is ultra quiet, which fits great in my ultra-quiet case. Given I don't need the extra overlocking speed, I'll save on power draw for now and enjoy a great card.\n\nNote, with the good power draw, this card is great in smaller or more restrictive cases as well, as it should still keep cool. Just keep in mind, it's not the gamer 215W version of the card. You might be able to squeeze a bit more performance out of that one, but I still think there's no need. Enjoy the quiet and power efficient performance, it's an amazing card."

I run cooling at 100% and these fans do a pretty good job without too much noise. I should say I am running a total of 17 fans & even though all but the water and power and video are noctua 1700rpm and variable 3000 in the rear running about half speed. It is not as loud as you would imagine. I used an Anidees AI Raider XL case and took great care doing my best i could to dampen sound. Anyhow BIG case great thermal control So the card though i kept it on the Mobo gets plenty of airflow so i can stress the system without it throttling down the video. If i were going for gaming rig though and had the $$$ i would prefer something water cooled as the case has the ability to house a 360mm 2nd radiator. Heck by the time i post this better options no doubt exist though from what i have seen the prices & availabilty still kinda suck. Look no flashy lights just a good heatsink & fans that are up to the task, no badges [We don't need no stinking badges.].\n\nI chose this card as at the time it was the right choice and has good cooling capability, but if you need to edit 8k you might be as well off with an RTX3600 v2 as it is far more cost effective & with good cooling options or by now 4060ti these things move faster than reviews are, well very time sensitive."

I do slightly underclock most of my hardware now days though since there is virtually no performance loss while keeping it 15-20 C cooler than factory default.\n\nHighly recommend. No coil whine. Runs cool. Runs any game on the market. I wish it was cheaper though. Also keep in mind that this card is HUGE. I am 6ft and the card is longer than my entire forearm. Reaches from the elbow all of the way to the middle of the palm of my hand. Will probably stick with MSI products after this purchase."

        "review": "This was the final piece to my near full PC rebuild, and it was a dramatic increase from my previous GTX 1060 6GB. Runs games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate incredibly well at 1080p, especially with DLSS enabled and without temps rising any higher than around 60-70°C. My only issue with this card initially was a loud and jarring coil whine, but this was remedied with an upgraded power supply. This is a great card for anyone who needs a current generation GPU to play just about any current generation game without breaking the bank for a 4080 or 4090. Although probably not the card you need if you're looking to do 4k gaming or serious rendering or AI work, but suits 1080p gaming and occasional video rendering perfectly."

        "review": "Never bought an AMD card before this one. I was considering this card or the 4070ti since both offered a big boost in performance over my 3080. I ultimately chose this card due to the lower price, more vram, and this card using 2 standard 8 pin connectors instead of the new 12pin on Nvidia cards. And I have to say I am very impressed with this card.\n\nTo give you a comparison these are some average fps between my old 3080 and this card using a 1440p 165hz monitor. An i5 12600k cpu and 32Gb DDR4 ram at 3200Mhz CL16.\n\nRTX 3080\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Darktide (High) 100-110fps\nCyberpunk 2077 (High with DLSS set to performance) 75 - 90fps\nWar Thunder (High and very high) 165 - 185fps\nSons of the Forest (Medium preset) 75 - 85fps\n\nRX 7900 XT\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Darktide (High with FSR set to quality and ray tracing set to custom) 135 - 150fps\nCyberpunk 2077 (High and Ultra with FSR set to balanced) 125 - 150fps\nWar Thunder (High and very high) 250 - 285fps\nSons of the Forest (Ultra preset) 85 - 95fps\n\nOverall this card performs very well. It runs quiet and uses less power then my 3080. It's built solid with an all metal casing which gives it a good amount of weight. You'll want to use the included gpu bracket with this card. AMD's Adrenalin software is intuitive, easy to navigate, and I found easier to use then Nvidia's.\n\nIf there are any cons it would be it's size. If you're using a smaller case you'll want to double check that it can fit. With the included gpu bracket the card is almost 15inches long and almost 3 and a half slots thick. But if it fits it's an excellent card."

        "review": "Une belle et performante carte. La qualité de fabrication est très bonne et les matériaux de qualité. Je trouve la carte très belle, elle est très sobre (peut être trop à mon goût) avec juste le logo XFX en blanc. Je ne note pas de différence flagrante de qualité entre celle-ci et ma 7900XTX Asus Tuf. Une différence est que la XFX utilise une chambre à vapeur et la Asus non. La XFX est moins épaisse que la Asus mais presque aussi longue. La carte dispose en effet de dimensions généreuse (344mm de longueur), assurez vous que cela passe dans votre boitier avant de commander. Pour ma part sur cette config dans un Cooler Master MB511 ça passe sans soucis la taille maximum pour un gpu étant de 410mm. Comme je l'ai dit elle est moins imposante que ma TUF 7900XTX (voir photo) mais ça reste une carte balèze. Les performance sont au rendez-vous, heureusement à cette gamme de prix et cette carte est clairement taillée pour pouvoir faire de la 4K et rempli à merveille son office sur mon second PC sur un téléviseur 4K. Mon 11700K sur cette machine bride peut-être un peu la carte en 4K même si sur le panel de jeux que j'ai testé ça tourne très bien. 60 fps de moyenne en Ultra sur Starfield, Cyberpunk hors RT tourne très bien et pareil 60fps sans soucis, Resident Evil 4 Remake la carte se balade et sur beaucoup d'autres jeux, comme sur Doom Eternal avec Ray Tracing, c'est la Vsync avec la TV qui limite le framerate, j'ai une télé 60Hz, la carte est clairement se balade. Niveau température, c'est du très bon. Maximum 68 degrés sur le GPU et 84 degrés sur le Hot Spot quand la carte est utilisée à 100% et ce après plusieurs heures de jeux. C'est vraiment très bien et tout ça en silence. Ces températures là sont obtenues en ayant overclocké la carte avec une fréquence pic de 3100mhz sur le GPU et 2650mhz sur la mémoire avec un undervolt à 1070mv et le power limit à + 15%. La carte consomme alors 400 watts donc les températures sont carrément OK. La carte deviendra bruyante si les températures montent énormément, ça arrive parfois sur Starfield où le HotSpot atteint les 90 degrés et alors la ventilation s'actionne à haut régime, mais je n'ai constaté ce phénomène que sur Starfield où l'optimisation n'est pas parfaite et il y a parfois des chutes de framerate aléatoires sur des zones précédemment visitées. Si votre boitier est correctement ventilé pas d'inquiétudes sur les températures surtout si vous ne faites pas d'overclock où elle consommera 350 watts à stock et donc chauffera moins. D'ailleurs j'ai vu pas mal de test sur le net indiquant qu'elle était bruyante en charge et comparé à ma Asus TUF 7900XTX c'est très proche et pourtant sur ces review la Asus ne souffre globalement pas de ce reproche. Le support Z-bar de XFX inclus est bien conçu, en métal, et inspire confiance plus que le support fourni par Asus par exemple. C'est la première carte XFX que j'achète et après 15 jours d'utilisation j'en suis très content. Ça tourne impeccable, en silence avec des températures maitrisées. Concernant le vendeur NRINFO, c'est du tout bon. Expédition rapide, service client très réactif et code Starfield Premium reçu le jour de la livraison de la carte. C'est top.\nEn résumé une très bonne carte qui se rapproche de près d'une RTX4080 (hors Ray Tracing) une fois OC. À ce prix je ne vois rien en face. Il y a bien la 6950XT qui propose environ 15% de perfs en moins pour 220€ de moins (chez NRINFO d'ailleurs, les autres 6900XT étant plus chères) mais à partir d'une certaine somme je préfère partir sur la dernière génération. En résumé une belle carte, bien construite et parfaite pour de la 4k ou du 1440p à haut framerate. Un big up à NRINFO qui a été impeccable concernant ma commande."

        "review": "Bought the 7900 XT a couple months ago and i love it so far. Built a whole new system, upgrading from the one i built near 7 years ago. Paired this card up with my Ryzen 7900X and it works flawlessly. Upgraded from my Ryzen 1700 with a GTX 1070, so was a fairly substantial upgrade.\n\nI kept waiting and waiting for the GPU market to stop being crazy and finally i put down the money build a new system so i could give my old one to my little brother. Glad i did. Was a little scary to jump ship off of nVidia, but with how anti-consumer the green team is i decided to try out team red.\n\nThere were a couple of things to get used to from switching sides, but overall not a big deal. I love the driver software. Non-invasive, unlike Nvidia's geforce experience. I should not have to log in just so i can install drivers.\n\nAt the end of the day you get roughly the rasterization power of a 4080, but at 400 dollars cheaper of a price tag. If you care about ray tracing it does an alright job, roughly around a 4070. I dont NEEEEEED ray tracing, but even with it at max it runs just fine at 1440p. Plus with FSR 3, if you turn it on, it runs even better.\n\nAMD also has Fluid Frame generation now and it truly does work with all DX 11 + games and it can give you twice or more frames. Truly AMD is more consumer friendly than nvidia. Hell even my old 1070 can use FSR 3 if the game supports FSR 3."

De plus vous pouvez faire confiance a ce vendeur situé au Portugal sans soucis.\n\nParlons de la carte. C'est ma première CG de la marque XFX, bien qu'il y est mieux en custom, c'est une superbe carte custom (qualité, Vbios etc) à des prix imbattable comparé à d'autre Custom.\n\nCôté performances, c'est un monstre, n'achetez pas une carte comme ça pour jouer en 1080P, même pour de la 1440P elle est OverKill. Cette carte est destiné à la 1440P haut Hz et surtout la 4K. Je joue sur un écran 1440P 165Hz, la carte en a tellement sous la capot, que c'est facile d'atteindre des hautes fréquence avec des paramètres graphique à fond ou presque.\nPour l'OC, les cartes AMD montre tout leurs potentiels, avec leur Vbios d'origine, en UderVoltant la tension et en augmentant les fréquences. La mienne, sans trop pousser, atteints 28 000 de scores sur Time Spy et peut monter plus haut.\nPour le bruit, je joue toujours avec un casque, avec une courbe de ventilation perso, donc je l'entends pas.\n\nBref, c'est une superbe carte, destiné à de gros joueurs, a un prix correct (comparé a la concurrence et aux autres 7900XT), avec de grosses performances."

Bravo au vendeur NR Info qui ne gonfle pas les prix.\n- Ce modèle de refroidissement est compétent: température totalement sous contrôle avec un max de 59°C. Ventilos à 1600rpm max. Très peu de coil whine, c'est jour et nuit par rapport à une 3090 FE.\n- La qualité XFX au rendez-vous: XFX fournit avec la carte un support optionnel pour garder la carte rigide et droite en utilisant les accroches PCIe du dessous (les slots restent accessibles et utilisables pour autre chose). Rappel: ce n'est pas simplement esthétique, maintenir le PCB droit aide à garantir la longévité d'une carte en évitant des tensions qui peuvent abimer des composants à la longue. Par ailleurs, la carte est solide, élégante et sobre. La backplate est fonctionnelle, pas purement esthétique: il y a des pads thermiques et une réelle surface de dissipation pour aider à refroider mémoire et puces.\n- Le vendeur NR Info en particulier: basé au Portugal (merci Schengen!), livré bien avant la prévision par des transporteurs sérieux (DPD puis Chronopost), dans un emballage soigné.\n\nPourquoi pas parfait?\n- Toujours trop cher pour ce que c'est. Je ne suis pas fan de l'inflation des prix des cartes graphiques par AMD et Nvidia (ce dernier étant plus coupable). Si vous ne tenez pas à une garantie, de bien meilleues deals sont possibles en occasion sur des 3090/3090 Ti ou 6950XT.\n- Ce modèle XFX, comme l'appuient le test de Techpowerup, est simplement compétent mais loin d'être le meilleur. La carte au maximum (59°C et 1600rpm) est bien audible sans jamais être bruyante. D'autres comme Asus ou Sapphire font plus silencieux, certes en triple/quadruple slot (et plus cher!). Cette XFX est longue, mais peu épaisse par rapport à la concurrence, elle permet de garder ses slots PCIe et de donner de l'espace aux ventilos pour respirer. Au final je l'ai prise parce que c'était ce qui était disponible au prix officiel, pas parce que c'était la meilleure. À prix équivalent, privilégier les modèles Sapphire/Asus.\n- Janvier 2023, toujours beaucoup de bugs/crashs en jeu. On est bien dans la situation classique du manque d'optimisation au lancement. Les pilotes méritent encore plusieurs mois au four. On n'en est pas au désastre des Intel Arc, mais proche sur certains jeux, qui crashent à. chaque. fois. (!) rendant le jeu impossible sans bidouiller (World War Z). Sur d'autres jeux, c'est simplement des FPS un peu décevants, qui sont au niveau d'une 3090 (Warhammer 40K Darktide). Enfin, impossible pour ma part de modifier la limite de puissance/overclocker, les réglages se réinitialisent quand on clique appliquer (Afterburner et Radeon Software). RÉSOLU: il suffit de passer le bouton vBIOS vers la droite, qui est un BIOS débloqué qui permet l'overclock/undervolt/augmentation power limit à +15%/contrôle des ventilos. Les problèmes de drivers persistent. AMD, au boulot.\n- La 7900 XTX représente un meilleur rapport/qualité prix à son prix officiel de 1140€ environ, mais elle est indisponible à ce prix la pour l'instant, contrairement à la 7900 XT. Après, parler de rapport qualité-prix entre une carte à 999€ et une autre a 1140€ reste de l'hérésie à mes yeux...\n\nLe bilan reste positif et je suis satisfait de mon achat."

This card fit the bill perfectly. No issues with Temps or noise. Came with Resident Evil 4.\n\nThose complaining about 8gb vram. Drop your settings. No need for all Ultra on a 24\" 1080p monitor."

I will say, if you have a smaller case, you do have to insert the card at a bit of an angle to get it into the PCIE slot completely. If not, your VGA light will be on and you will get no display.

The tdp is great on this card is says psu rated at 750w but I have a 650w asus gold rated psu and have had 0 issues it’s a great card all around I’d consider it even though people stay hating on these cards.🫶🏻"

Difficult to remove, so maybe test the connection on the jack before popping it into the wall plate. The cat6 cable had a thicker sheath, so was a tight fit when putting on the cover of the keystone jack. Ended up cutting the sheath back further than I normally would.\n\nVery good value for the cost, enough to get 10 jacks done. Would be nice to get larger sized versions of this kit. Will buy this brand again, when I need more."

Obviously, that won't be an issue if you're starting a new build or doing a physical deep clean.\n\nI was a little concerned if it may be too big even for the microATX case I have considering how close it is to the PSU, but no issues here so far.\n\nOther than the things I stated, I really like it! Super quiet and gives even the most basic mATX build a premium gamer aesthetic. Idling, the CPU stays in the 20s. And I really like that it came with an actual tube of strong thermal paste since I wanted to reseat the heatsink on my GPU as well."

Twice.\nThis model of RAM is on my motherboard's official list of compatible RAM.\nOn first install, my PC wouldn't POST. I then tested one RAM stick at a time where I discovered that one of the sticks was defective.\nI figured I just got unlucky so I contacted Corsair to see if I could simply RMA one of the sticks. A week later, Corsair demanded I send in BOTH sticks for RMA. Obviously, this would mean I wouldn't have a working PC for at least a month or two, so I explained this dilemma to Corsair. Unsurprisingly, Corsair gave zero consideration to my issue, so I decided I would just order another pair and return the original to Amazon as defective.\nAfter installing the second pair there were seemingly zero issues. Lol.\nThree months later, my PC begins randomly crashing. Tuning RAM in BIOS didn't fix anything. I again tested one RAM stick at a time, and lo and behold, one of the RAM sticks was defective. Again.\nAs I'm beyond the return window, I decided to just buy a pair from a different company.\n\nSo here's yet another review reporting that one of the RAM sticks of this model came defective. Twice.\nGiven that other brands are roughly the same price, you might as well go with those. It simply isn't worth the time and headache gambling against the defectiveness of this particular product."

I literally have to get refund and repurchase.\n\ngoing to give these one more chance purchasing another set of 2X32 as I return the bad ones. if this fails my review will drop to zero and will stay away from these rams sticks, otherwise will update as we run these overtime. I have built pc's that are running for 8 years straight without any issues. i am hoping this build would be another one.\n\nupdate: the new pair that arrived worked 100%, ran mem test just in case and it passed. not sure what happened with the bad pair where both ram sticks where failing mem test and causing windows to crash with memory error. odd that its part of same batch as if its manufacturing quality check error. so giving it 4 stars out of 5 as i had to spend time testing and returning the sticks which i would expect the manufacturer to perform proper quality check before i would get them."

Me gusta ensamblar yo mismo mis equipos y busqué una motherboard que tuviera el soporte para la 13va generación de Intel encontrando esta que menciono. Realicé el ensamble en el case Cougar Conquer 2, el ensamble de procesador, cableados, conexiones y enfriadores súper fácil siguiendo los manuales. El dolor de cabeza vino cuando una vez instaladas las memorias CORSAIR el equipo no era capaz de bootear y prendía la luz naranja indicando problema en el VRAM es decir en las memorias CORSAIR DDR5, pensé que quizá las memorias venían dañadas o quizá yo hice alguna conexión errónea por lo que decidí repetir mi ensamble completo =D. Una vez completado el error permanecía y ninguno de los manuales ayudaba con algún posible FIX para corregir el error. Después de ponerlas y retirarlas N veces empecé a preparar una devolución de las memorias porque todo indicaba estaban dañadas. Vi algunos videos en internet y encontré una guía para un problema similar que recomendaban aplicar un UPDATE del BIOS. Por mi falta de experiencia desmonté nuevamente todo mi ensamble y realicé el UPDATE del BIOS a través de la conexión trasera FLASHBACK que provee esta motherboard realizándolo sin ningún componente instalado, después supe que no era necesario haber desensamblado todo mi ensamble por 3a vez y pude haberlo realizado con todo instalado =D El update del BIOS tomó alrededor de 20 minutos y una vez concluido realicé el ensamble nuevamente y WOOW el booteo se hizó de manera correcta levantando mi ensamble. Ejecuté la función de Overclocking de Intelligence Overclock de ASUS y las memorias fueron ajustadas a correr a 5600Mhz (su velocidad nativa es de 5200Mhz), después de más de 1 mes de uso no he tenido ningún problema y estoy más que FELIZ con mi adquisición, súper recomendables estas memorias para tu ensamble. Yo adquirí 2 memorias de 32GB cada una y si en un momento por alguna necesidad decido llevarlo a 128GB no dudaré en adquirir este modelo de Memorias. Espero mi experiencia ayude a alguien más en su ensamble / Upgrade usando estas memorias de CORSAIR."

        "review": " Im very happy with this Corsair DDR5-5200mhz memory. It looks great on my mostly white build PC and I have it running at 5400 via a user configurable XMP profile in my Gigabyte z690 aero D-BIOS.\n\nIt was not obvious at first why it was running at 4800 and that I only seemed to have one XMP profile to set. but as I discovered you can have up to 3 xmp profiles once set under advanced memory settings and SPD (Gigabyte z690 aero D)\n\nI'm sure this memory can be run at a higher frequency but that will involve changing voltages and timings which can be troublesome if not done correctly, and the BIOS will have to be reset.\n\nYou can check easily if you have the correct speed by going to Windows Task manager/Performance and Memory tab, or,download cpu-z app.\n\nI will purchase another 64bg of this memory to give me a total of 128gb for my system, which will be useful for vst libraries and video editing etc. But this will more than likely require adjusting voltages, etc, to get the required speed.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nUPDATE. I bought another pair of these sticks (black) for a total of 128gb\n\nI got the 64gb Corsair DDR5-5200mhz kits in the black version for an excellent price; this was to add to my Corsair 64GB DDR5-5200mhz white kit for a total of 128gb for my system. I would have preferred the white version I previously bought for my PC build, but the black sticks were much cheaper than what I originally paid; it was a no-brainer.\n\nI have these sticks and the white ones in an MSI z790 edge wi-fi motherboard. I had a Gigabyte z690 D aero, with 64gb white set in my original review , but I had to get another motherboard for various reasons.\n\nWith just two sticks in my motherboard I managed to get them running stable at 5400mhz. (XMP profiles), which was great, but when I added 4 sticks at 128gb, the fastest I could get was 4800mhz, that was both motherboards.\n\nHowever, Recently MSI updated their BIOS for this board which included fixes for better memory compatibility, so, I decided to try get 5200mhz running again, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, for a while. But, even after passing a memory test and playing a few games without any problems, I got a windows green screen error when I was closing down an app. So then, I decided to try and get at least 5000mhz running, which I have them running at now, stable. Actually, they are running at 5067mhz.\n\nI'm very happy with this speed and do not mind losing 200mhz from the speed they are supposed to run at. In fact, the speed difference when I had 64GB running at 5200 and beyond is actually quite negligible, according to various memory tests.\n\nOverall, I think this memory performs well and is from a top tier brand, which means better compatibility with motherboards. With future BIOS updates, perhaps 128gb might run at 5200 and beyond, stable, here's hoping.\n\nHighly recommended\n\nUPDATE 2.\n\nMSI released another BIOS update (7D91vH4) for my z790 wifi edge motherboard, which includes improved memory compatibility and many other updates. I updated it and adjusted the Dram frequency to 5200Mhz G2, while disabling the XMP profile, and it has been running stable while doing memory tests and playing games etc.\n\nMy current system specs:\nI9-13900k\nMSI z790 wi-fi edge\nGigabyte RTX 4070 aero\nAsus Essence STX II sound card\nKingston 1tb KC3000 PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD\nArctic liquid freezer II 360 RGB AiO\nAnother 3 nvme drives and two ssd’s"

You can set it to EXPO 1 timing with at 1.35V you can get it to run at 4600Mhz stable. 4800Mhz will give you at C5 boot error and 4800Mhz at 1.4v will give you a E6 boot error. This is the same with both kits I purchased, which have two different firmware versions.\n\nHopefully when a bios with AGESA 1.0.0.9 is released the board won't be so picky about it's Ram. If not I'll probably wind up selling the kits and getting a different set from the the tested list. At the time I purchased the kits very few kits were listed in 64GBs, but it's still on me for taking the risk."

Faster IS better too if you can afford it, BUT, in Ram, you really want QUANTITY even more than speed.\n\nThis is non RGB Ram, nothing really fancy, but it looks nice & is a clean design that won't break your pocket book.\n\nSpeeds & timings are a little on the slower side but specs are good & everything works as it should.\n\nRam is usually something that goes bad years down the road if it DOES go bad, or unless you get a bad stick out of the box which is rare, so only time will tell on the durability of this Ram. But it's good out of the gate as it were.\nHas a 5 year warranty if you have any issues with yours.\n\n2 sticks of 8gb, a total of 16gb of Ram is enough for most every day uses & PC's. Even 8gb is usually adequate. The less Ram you have though, the faster it will \"fill up\" & the more you will need to do a full restart to clear it so your PC doesn't slow down.\n\n16gb is a good place to start as far as capacity. I always like to get a MoBo that has 4 slots for Ram though, and start with filling 2 of the slots with half the capacity of the MoBo, and then you have the option to double that later on with matched Ram. ...It's really best to not mix & match Ram BTW. Try to get the same kind & capacity sizes when you do add some. At least be sure you match the timings to prevent issues.\n\nThis is good Ram though, especially if you're on a tighter budget."

I thought the memory was of wrong spec, so returned it. But I verified online the same spec should have worked. So I ordered this Timetec memory from Amazon and to my surprise it worked!! So the original memory I had purchased was bad.\n\nNOTE: From my experience after sticking the memory on Bank0 and Bank1 and powering Synology DS718+ the blue light will blink for a while but no more than 2- 4 minutes. If it goes beyond that then the memory is bad and Synology DS718+ is not able to recognize it."

        "review": "# VERSIONE LUNGA (andare in fondo per quella breve):\n\nInvogliato dal prezzo interessante ho acquistato un secondo blocco da testare con uno \"identico\" sempre 2x8 DDR4-CL18 Corsair abbinate ad un chipset X470. Mentre prima riuscivo tramite XMP a farle funzionare a 3600, ora con i 4 slot occupati non si riesce più. La configurazione 4x8GB è a mio parere da evitare se si volesse utilizzare il profilo XMP fornito dalla Corsair, anche se sono stessa marca e modello.\n\nDipende molto sia dal chipset della motherboard che dal tipo di CPU abbinata. Non solo. Dipende anche dalla \"lotteria del silicio\", ovvero dalla fortuna di trovare RAM con chip (di silicio) di miglior qualità.\n\nAnalizzando bene le memorie ho potuto constatare che a questo giro il DRAM MANUFACTURER è \"Hynix\" (senza alcun riferimento al DIE Revision) mentre l'altra volta \"Micron Technology\" con DIE rev. E\n\nQuesto fatto non implica il non funzionamento delle RAM, ma rende più \"rognoso\" spingerle ai valori dichiarati dall'XMP certificati, in presenza di CPU con limiti sulla gestione delle frequenze delle memorie. Per esempio un Ryzen serie 2000 gestisce DDR da 2933MHz, mentre un Ryzen serie 3000 gestisce DDR da 3200 MHz. In entrambi i casi si possono \"anche\" spingere le ram a frequenze superiori, ma va a fortuna.\n\nEcco che scegliere 4x8 o 2x16 potrebbe fare la differenza in termini di stabilità. Se con due slot occupati si riesce a tenere la RAM a 3600 MHz, con quattro (e alcune CPU su certe schede madri) la frequenza massima supportata cala a 3466 MHz (se va bene). Infatti per ora non posso testarle alla loro frequenza nativa, me le tengo comunque visto il prezzo. Lo sapevo che sono ram basilari.\n\nConsiglio quindi di acquistare queste 3600 MHz se l'interesse principale è quello di espandere la quantità di memoria, anche in virtù di un prezzo decente. Sono a basso profilo, discretamente raffreddate, ma le considero per lo più RAM da utilizzo generico, anche gaming. Magari su altre mobo riescono a rispondere in maniera migliore.\n\nLe 3600 MHz però sono più veloci!!! Non è così perché la frequenza non è il solo parametro da considerare. I timings infatti sono fondamentali per capire la reale velocità delle memorie. Queste hanno una CAS LATENCY (CL) che vale 18 (CL 18). Se le rapportiamo a DDR 3200 MHz da CL 16 scopriamo che hanno praticamente la stessa velocità. Per trasformare CL in nanosecondi si procede così:\n\n(CL nativa) / (frequenza di utilizzo reale se supportata) * 2000 = ... ns\n\nCL 18 / 3600 * 2000 = 10 ns\nCL 16 / 3200 * 2000 = 10 ns\n\nCaso migliore sarebbe poter spingere queste 3600 con CL 16:\n\nCL 16 / 3600 * 2000 = 8.8 ns\n\nCaso peggior invece è quando non regge timings più bassi e la cpu/mobo non riescono a tenere nemmeno la frequenza nativa (massimo 2933 o 3200 MHz)\n\nCL 18 / 2933 * 2000 = 12,27 ns (più alto = più lenta)\nCL 18 / 3200 * 2000 = 11,25 ns (più alto = più lenta)\n\nCosì è spiegato facile, ma i timings sono tutti collegati tra loro e richiedono approfondimenti e tanta lettura. Vale la pena cambiarli? Direi di no. Vale la pena farlo perché si ampliano le conoscenze ed è divertente spremere qualche fps o nanosecondo in più, ma la componente fortuna (su componenti di qualità base) è LA discriminante principale. Se siete sfortunati con i chip non c'è OC che tenga...\n\nQuesto per dire che le ram vanno certamente abbinate alla CPU che si vuole montare. Non ha molto senso comprare RAM con frequenza superiore pensando che \"andrà più veloce\". Se la CPU supporta massimo ram da 3200MHZ allora si comprano ram da 3200MHz. Chi vuole fare OC sulla RAM lo può comunque fare e una ram da 3600 (tenuta a timings standard) riesce a gestirlo tranquillamente; il problema però risiede nella \"bontà\" del chipset della scheda madre e nella fortuna di avere una CPU fortunata che digerisce ram più spinte in frequenza. Meglio se le ram hanno lo stesso manufacturer, DIE e stessa REV.\n\nLa differenza in gaming non è poi così marcata anche se qualche FPS in più non fa mai male. Sempre considerando che 5/10 fps partendo da una base di 120 fps è una cosa, mentre 5/10 fps partendo da 52fps è un'altra.\n\nPer esempio facendo uno di quei test 3D (non faccio nomi) per le GPU si nota che impostando queste ram a 2133 MHz (CL15, 15, 15, 36@1,2V) il divario con la loro frequenza massima supportata 3600 (CL 18, 22, 22, 42@1,35V) è pressoché inesistente. Gli FPS medi (average) sono praticamente identici, ma cambiano leggermente (e positivamente) quelli minimi e massimi. Cambiano i test di lettura e scrittura, cambiano parecchio perché sono molto influenzati dalla frequenza e da timing spinti. Però nella realtà cambia molto aspettare 50 sec o 1 minuto e qualche secondo? Se le finanze lo permettono allora si potrà investire in ram più performanti, ma sempre rispettando l'abbinamento corretto con CPU e MOBO.\n\nI benchmark hanno senso? Direi \"SNI\" perché quello che conta è l'uso quotidiano. Se poi si vuole fare la \"gara\" a chi ce l'ha più \"veloce\"... va bene..., ma un gioco che gira a 90 fps tutto ultra non beneficerà poi così tanto di una ram apparentemente più veloce. Arriva a 95Fps? Sai che roba... mentre se si parte da 55fps allora raggiungere i 60fps potrebbe portare un valore aggiunto importante. Una fluidità più costante.\n\n# VERSIONE BREVE (tornare sopra se non vi basta):\n- abbinare sempre la RAM alla frequenza supportata dalla cpu (spesso si risparmia e si investe in altri componenti)\n- frequenza maggiore non significa necessariamente ram migliore.\n- non farsi prendere dalla smania dei 3/5 fps in più (tutti poi da dimostrare) Vorrei proprio vedere chi riesce a notare la differenza... tra ram da 3200MHz e 3600MHz.\n- sono ram standard per configurazioni standard, da valutare le 3600 se c'è la previsione di upgrade della CPU. Un Ryzen 5800X nativamente supporta ancora le 3200MHz... e per fare un po' di OC occorrono forse ram di fascia più alta...\n- prezzo buono per ampliare la quantità di memoria (pochi giochi e applicazioni richiedono 32GB)\n- meglio sempre acquistare 2x16GB invece che 4x8GB, ma se il prezzo è buono si può rischiare anche il 4x8GB. Ovvio che se uno possiede già 2x8 non ha molta scelta...\n- 2x8 GB vanno ancora benissimo per la stragrande maggioranza dei casi.\n- preferire timings più bassi se le finanze lo permettono\n- la stabilità viene prima di tutto\n- 5 stelle no, ma 4,5 sì\n\nIn allegato i due screen delle due coppie da 2x8 (una coppia è Micron, l'altra -più recente agosto 2022- risulta Hynix)"

With a little bit of research and the use of the program CPUID, I figured out what speed my 8gb stick was and decided my best bet for compatibility was getting something that ran at the same speed. The max amount of RAM my motherboard supports is 32gb so this was perfect. Only two slots so I plugged them in side by side, at first slightly not in all the way. I didn't want to break anything. Once they were in right, the computer turned on properly, and everything has been great since. Any game my computer was struggling to run when I only had the 8gb stick is now running superbly with the 32gb. Corsair seems to have a pretty high reputation so purchasing their product was kind of a no-brainer. Haven't tried any of their other products, but their RAM has been good to my computer and I would purchase other products made by them again."

There isn't any software to install or customise the RAM, it just works.\nAppearance wise there not as flashy as other more expensive sticks however they are still clean looking and blend with a matching colour motherboard very well.\n\nThese usually go on deals around Black Friday or Prime Day, which the deals are exceptionally good.\n\nOverall I can recommend these RAM sticks, for the price they are excellent. Very simple but works well."

They were the same as the last two I bought to augment the original two sets of 4x4's, so now I've got four sets of 2x8's. I have so many windows open with so many tabs right now, and I can do this while playing Destiny 2 and rendering video in Premier without my computer grinding to a halt. If your mobo is of the type that takes this particular RAM (do consult your motherboard's manual to find out what MHz and which brands and such your board can take before making a RAM decision) then I totally recommend these sets.\n\nSidenote: I gave it 5 stars for ease of install since my motherboard has them just click into place so I don't need to pop the clips in manually or anything like that. It also has them spaced nicely flanking my processor, which has a low profile liquid cooling unit attached so there's plenty of room for my hands to insert them. Depending on where your RAM slots are on your board, and how large the other contents of your tower are, YMMV as far as ease of installation."

Rebooted and booted into windows, have been using it now for a few days and works fine, computer runs stable and no issues. Slightly faster in compiling, project which took 2 minutes sharp now compiles in 1m50. Not a huge difference, but still a nice improvement nonetheless for the 15 euro the 3600 version cost more than the 3200 memory."

I haven't tested them at higher speeds and didn't feel the need too. I have more than enough memory to service my needs.

If you have any other RGB controllers in your PC you will likely run into issues with what's actually controlling the RAM lighting, no matter what I change and how many times I try to disable the other services from connecting to the RAM it just doesn't work as smooth as it should."

I downloaded it then installed and went into set some different colors. There were some strange buttons that didn't show pictures but would pop up text as to either set, accept or delete profile.\nRegardless I set the Rams color that I liked and eventually my PC went to sleep, the Ram didn't turn off? After reading up it made sense as the RGB gets constant power from the 5 volt rail. Ok well there is a fix and that one was first I uninstalled and reinstalled the software and that fixed my menu issues, in fact the interfaced to the better as if it updated.\nTo set the Ram to go to sleep and turn off I applied this form the forum at Corsair.\n\nActually it is possible to disable the lighting for Corsair Vengeance RBG PRO RAM in iCUE.\n1. Open iCUE\n2. Click \"LIGHTING EFFECTS\" on the left panel\n3. Delete ALL lighting effects\n4. Click \"SETTINGS\" on the iCUE title bar\n5. Toggle \"Enable full software control\" to the opposite of what it was just on\n6. Click \"LIGHTING EFFECTS\" on the left panel again\n7. Delete ALL lighting effects\n8. Click \"SETTINGS\" on the iCUE title bar\n9. Make sure that the \"Enable full software control\" box indicates it is enabled, if not, enable it\n10. Click \"LIGHTING EFFECTS\" on the left panel again\n11. Customize your lighting effects at your discretion\n\nYou should now have disabled all lighting effects while your machine is asleep.\nVerify by putting computer to sleep.\n\nThis fixed mine and now I have been playing with various colors so it's all good! Excellent RAM!"

If you're thinking of buying this, and it's on sale, I'd definitely go for it as it offers great value for the money and looks superb.\nNow...\nOriginally it did get off to a worrying start as there was an issue with the product and didn't know if it was us or what. I spent a few hours diagnosing what the problem could've been, but I ended up having to request a replacement set to be sent & I also had to visit a shop 15 minutes away because the normal local shop I drop off to wasn't available to return the first set of RAM but ended up sending them off.\nLuckily, the replacement arrived fairly quickly.

The customizable lighting effects are a treat for the eyes and allow for seamless integration with the rest of my RGB setup. Corsair's iCUE software provides an easy and intuitive way to fine-tune the lighting to match my setup's aesthetics perfectly.\n\nInstallation was a breeze; the modules fit snugly into my motherboard, and XMP profiling worked flawlessly to achieve the advertised speeds without any manual tweaking required.\n\nCorsair's build quality shines through as well. The heat spreaders not only keep the modules cool but also add to the overall aesthetics. The kit feels sturdy and well-made, which is something I value in any PC component.\n\nIn conclusion, the Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 16 GB kit is a top-tier choice for anyone looking to enhance their system's performance and visual appeal. The combination of impressive speed, low latency, and captivating RGB lighting make it a clear winner in its category. If you're in the market for high-quality RAM that delivers on all fronts, this kit should be at the top of your list. A solid 5-star product without a doubt!"

Die Riegel passten perfekt in meine vorhandenen RAM-Slots und wurden sofort von meinem Motherboard erkannt. Nach dem Hochfahren meines Systems konnte ich sofort eine spürbare Verbesserung der Gesamtleistung feststellen. Mein Computer lief deutlich reibungsloser und konnte mehr Aufgaben gleichzeitig bewältigen, ohne ins Stocken zu geraten.\n\nDie 3200MHz Geschwindigkeit sorgt für schnelle Datenübertragungsraten und trägt dazu bei, dass Anwendungen schneller geladen werden. Das ist besonders bei anspruchsvollen Anwendungen wie Bildbearbeitung, Videobearbeitung und sogar Spielen spürbar. Das Multitasking wird ebenfalls erleichtert, da der RAM genügend Spielraum bietet, um mehrere Programme gleichzeitig offen zu halten, ohne dass die Leistung darunter leidet.\n\nWas die Leistungssteigerung noch beeindruckender macht, ist der CL22-Timingswert. Obwohl dies nicht der niedrigste Timingswert auf dem Markt ist, hat Crucial hier eine gute Balance zwischen Geschwindigkeit und Stabilität gefunden. Die RAM-Riegel laufen absolut stabil und ich hatte keinerlei Probleme mit Abstürzen oder Freezes.\n\nDie Wärmeableitung wird durch die Aluminium-Heatspreaders auf den RAM-Riegeln unterstützt. Dies ist ein nettes Extra, besonders wenn du dazu neigst, längere Sessions mit intensiven Aufgaben zu haben. Die Temperaturen blieben während meiner Tests im akzeptablen Bereich, was zusätzliche Sicherheit und Langlebigkeit für den RAM bietet.\n\nAlles in allem bin ich äußerst zufrieden mit dem Crucial RAM 32GB Kit DDR4 3200MHz CL22. Es hat meine Erwartungen übertroffen und bietet eine spürbare Leistungssteigerung für meinen Desktop-PC. Die Qualität, die Geschwindigkeit und die Stabilität machen es zu einer hervorragenden Investition, besonders für diejenigen, die ihre Computerleistung verbessern möchten, sei es für den professionellen oder den Gaming-Bereich.\"\nLeider hatte ich keine Gelegenheit, es vor der Installation zu fotografieren"

        "review": "I've been using Kingston ram for about 7 years now, their higher models offer competitive speeds and timings to other brands. With less noticeably impactful components in comparisson to say a GPU or CPU I will recommend on brand from my experience with their stability or customer service since most users won't notice a difference in practice. I used this particular model in a build last year and it hasn't caused any headaches and the system works great. RAM likely won't be a large bottleneck for the average gamer in speed or capacity but new windows versions and poorly optimized triple A games are putting the latter to the test along with single stick pre-built pcs. If you're looking for a capacity upgrade or need to swap to dual channel this will work great. Highly recommend."

Still havnt enabled the xmp on it to get advertised speeds but it’s good fast ram. Runs stable, should be able to get my advertised 3600mhz but even if it doesn’t they were decently priced and fit my build.\n\nWorks with my Ryzen 7 5700x and fits in my Corsair 200T case which required ram height of 38mm or less with a top mounting AIO.\nI believe it’s single side chips ram which make them kinda over priced for being 16Gb mods.\n\nCorsairs ram was an issue and so I thought I’d give these a try and they weren’t to disappoint.\nKingston rams picked up the ball where Corsair dropped it.\n\nI’d buy these again.\nPrice is okay."

Primera fecha de entrega estimada de este artículo, se cambia. Finalmente sale desde Italia, el día que estava previsto ser entregado. Dado que ya no podré atenderlo en la dirección original, el nuevo día de entrega que me indican, Amazon via web, me deja indicar un locker. La fecha prevista de entrega al locker es el 23-6. Efectivamente....pues no lo entregan. Lo intentan entregar el lunes 26-6...pero algo sucede y en dos intentos , no pueden. El dia 27-6, lo vuelven a intentar , y de nuevo por dos veces, no pueden.\nEntonces contacto con el servicio de atención al cliente via chat (hablo con dos personas diferentes), porque no puedo cambiar de nuevo la dirección de entrega, y me dicen que la cambian ellos y que seguro que el 28 la recibiré en la nueva dirección que ya no es un locker.....El día 28-6....como os podeis imaginar....NO lo intentan entregar en la nueva dirección sino que de nuevo van al locker y no pueden entregarlo.....de nuevo contacto por chat con el servicio al cliente.....de nuevo hablo con dos personas diferentes. Una me dice que cancela el pedido y me reembolsa el dinero, porque no se puede cambiar la dirección de entrega, y el locker está averiado y no pueden avisar al transportista ni el transportista me puede llamar a mi porque si la entrega es en un locker, no les consta el teléfono del destinatario. Digo, bueno, pues lo recompro y ya está.....pero al ir a recomprarlo, el precio se ha incrementado en un 30%.\nContacto de nuevo con servicio al cliente, me dan explicaciones, pero no soluciones, me ofrecen esperar al día siguiente para cancelar el pedido y intentar un reemplazo por el mismo precio antiguo......buff en este punto ya llevo dedicadas al chat tres horas.....quedamos asi.....pero finalmente, en un segundo intento de entrega del dia 28-6 a última hora, finalmente consiguen dejarlo en el locker...a pesar de que el servicio de atención al cliente el día 27 me aseguró que habian cambiado la dirección entrega....Conclusión...innumerables fallos imperdonables en un gigante como Amazon.\nNecesitais que os los remarque ????\n1- Sucesivos incumplimientos de fecha de entrega.\n2- Incomunicación entre transportista y Amazon teniendo un locker averiado.\n3- Imposibilidad de cambiar la dirección de entrega a pesar de que en el tracking de amazon se indica que se haga via Servicio al cliente.\n4- Servicio al cliente incoherente, con actitudes y aptitudes individuales y nada standarizadas.\n5- Si la entrega es en un locker, el transportista no tiene manera de avisar al cliente de cualquier incidencia.\n6- Poca optimización del transportista, hasta 6 intentos para entregarlo, donde no podía ni debía.\n7- Poca capacidad resolutiva del servicio de atención al cliente, toda actuación posible era a dias vista y con perjuicio para el cliente.\n\nYo he tenido tiempo y ganas para dedicar más de 6 horas de mi vida a esta incidencia...y eso sin contar los perjuicios que he tenido por el retraso en más de 6 dias en la entrega por incompetencia logística de Amazon.\nServirá para algo ?????\nMejorará Amazon algo en todos estos temas ????\n\nMe dejo algún otro problema visible en el chat mantenido con servicio al cliente, repito, casi tres horas entre dia 27 y 28….para nada."

Will not run at 3600 or anywhere beyond 3333 at advertised timings (18 22 22 22 42 and 1.38v). Probably pressed my power sw/reset about 25 times and ultimately pulled power cord a few times, so gave up. Did not open case and reset BIOS since a pain to do. Good luck to those who purchase\n\nUpdate after a few weeks\nI can now confirm that it runs at rated speeds and volts. However, pack your patience - required several resets power on/off, black screens (lost count) and at least 1 bios clear etc. Aalsmot corrupted Win 10 but I created system restore points just in case. I think the best thing is to burn them in for a few weeks then slowly raise to rated speeds - some speeds that my PC will not boot or boot a few times then stop are 3466 and 3533 for whatever reason. 3333 is fine but eventually this will stop. Loosening memory timings do not work. I used Bios memory settings for the correct rated speeds and confirmed with CPU-Z, AIDA and others. So long story short been running at 1T 18 22 22 22 42 65 1.36V for last 2 weeks stable. Don' know how my PC did not go up in smoke after all this. Hopefully it runs like this for the rest of the year"

It also comes with a 3yr warranty.\n\nI checked the datasheet specs on the manufacturer’s site for this driver and it seems the specs are a bit different. It shows a max of 2000MB/s Read and 1000MB/s write, so I wish they spent a bit more effort to provide the proper information on their packaging material.\n\nPerformance:\nI put the drive through its paces using an external USB-C NVMe enclosure as well as in a computer and running benchmarks using CrystalDiskMark8 as well copying files to and from the drive.\n\nUSB-C NVMe Enclosure:\n- CrystalDiskMark: Read = 1050.79MB/s and Write = 950.84MB/s.\n- Windows Write: Writing a 12.7GB file into the drive took 34.28secs = 370.48MB/s Write speed.\n- Windows Read: Copying out the same 12.7GB file took 37.4secs = 339.57MB/s Read speed.\n- Windows Write (small files): Writing 5.98GB of smaller multiple files ranging from a few hundred megs to 1GB into the drive took 67.24secs = 88.94MB/s.\no This was exceptionally slow as the peak speed was 54MB/s, but subsequent copy of the same data files were able to copy at 389MB/s.\n- Windows Read (small files): Copying the same 5.98GB of files out of the drive onto my laptop took 60.95secs = 98MB/s Read speeds.\no Recopying the same files out took only 16.31secs = 366MB/s\n\nDuring the speed tests, it seems on initial write & read of multiple smaller files the drive seems to struggle with the throughput as you can see it spike upwards and then slows down and then keeps repeating, so the transfer graph is very jagged. Subsequent copies of the same files into and out of the drive seems to work as it’s supposed to. Not sure if there’s a caching issue or if there was some other factor causing the slowness.\n\nHP Laptop Install:\nTo eliminate the USB port or enclosure as the speed limiting factor, I installed it into my laptop and installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 and reran the CrystalDiskMark tests and was pleasantly surprised that the max Read speed was 2360.39MB/s & the Write was 1200.26MB/s. The Read speeds jumped over 2X and the write speed up 25%.\n\nI couldn’t run the Windows copy as the laptop only had one drive and it wouldn’t be a proper test to copy from itself into itself.\n\nOverall, I found the LinkMore XE200 256GB PCIe NVMe 2280 M.2 drive performed very well. In an external enclosure, it performed OK, but that performance quickly jumped and exceeded its advertised specs on the manufacturer’s website datasheet specs when directly installed in a computer. The drive is actually faster than the original drive that came with the HP laptop and now is the permanent drive for the unit."

What I found is that this low-cost drive has so far performed almost as well as the higher priced big brand names. The only thing I can't comment on is how well it works over time compared to the other brands.\n👀 The only spec I will include is a screenshot of the write speed when first used in an external 10Gb USB C enclosure before installing it in the PC. While not as fast as brand name drives, this is plenty fast for most applications. It is faster than most users would need a drive to be. Boot time and shutdown are measured in seconds.\n» Pricing is in the ballpark with other after market brand drives of the same capacity.\n\nWould I recommend this for a gamer, someone that uses photo/video editing applications, or someone who doesn't back up their important items? No, not yet. It will need to prove itself over time, and no amount of testing with Crystal mark or other performance software can provide that detail. For the average user that does back up their important items, it's a great way to upgrade an older laptop or add a second drive to a PC if the MoBo has space. If there are any problems down the road, I will follow up.\n\nI have had it running on a PC as the OS drive that's been in operation 24/7 for the last four weeks. I'm using it to run a game server for some friends and which means there are a lot of writes, so this is a great test. It was installed with no issues, and both Windows 11 and Windows Server 2019 were installed without the need for any drivers. I tested it on Windows 11 but then installed Server 2019 for stability. Other than restarts due to updates, the machine has never gone down. It does have a decent heat sink on it and runs no hotter than the big brand name drives.\n\nDo I have enough confidence that if I needed another drive, I would get a second one of these, yes. I will need a 1TB NVMe drive in a couple of months for a new build, and considering the performance is very good, and the drive is 35% of what I would pay for a brand name, yes, I'll save some money and order a LinkMore."

If you are looking for something that's a significant upgrade to your existing/old SSD and in need of a budget drive as your system drive to speed up initial boot time, then perhaps give this a shot.\n\nThis is another one of those non-brand name NVMe SSDs that I've never heard of but it claims to be made in Taiwan which is much more desirable (if you build your own computers from parts especially in the 90's, then you know what I'm talking about); however, I see no indication that this is actually made in Taiwan so I'm not sure what to think of that at the moment.\n\nWith that being said, its performance is actually quite good considering its price.\n\nRead: 2183 MB/s\nWrite: 1089 MB/s\n\nBoth its read and write speeds appear to be slightly higher than what's being advertised here 2000/1000 MB/s); however, it claims a much higher throughput (2500/2100 MB/s) from the box it comes with. Though, it does mention the speed varies and depends up capacity which is often the case for any flash-based devices including USB drives and NVMe/SATA SSD drives.\n\nIt's using Phison PS5013-E13-31 SSD controller which does NOT include DRAM cache which is one of the reasons that this is a budget NVMe SSD. Well, you get what you pay for and it's a reasonably trade-off if you are short on budget.\n\nAll things considered, this is a fairly decent budget NVMe SSD that's well-performed and it's reasonably priced at $34 for 256GB. It's a great upgrade for ordinary SATA SSD (assuming your MB supports and/or has the slot for it) and you WILL see noticeable performance boost in in comparison to SATA SSDs."

It depends on the motherboard somewhat, but that's what I've gleaned from a YT video I watched assuming the motherboard has 4 slots.\n\nAlso, it's worth the while to check BIOS or download MSI to see what your comp will allow for ram speed. I bought 3200's going with the ram speed that the prebuilt came with, but could have used 3600's and would have, had I known in advance that I could. There is a modest improvement in performance, from 3200 to 3600 if a comp can go with higher mhz."

Lot's of headroom on these guys.\n\nMake sure your motherboard can handle overclocking these if you utilize these but most modern gaming pre-builts will already have a BIOS that makes it super easy.\n\nMakes my gaming and video editing more efficient by reducing render times."

        "review": "So when I got the ram I ended up spending like 1 to about two hours trying to install it. I got a asrock b450 pro4 board. I got a ryzen 5600x cpu I recently had 16gb of this ram, then I decided to get the 32gb version of it. My motherboard max ram is 64Gb adding it up I was basically installing 48Gb all together. But for some reason when I add the two 16gb sticks with the two 8gb sticks, my computer for some reason would not boot up. Now this was me switching the rams around trying to figure out what was the problem. Because before I had some different brand name rams I mixed it with the Vulcan’s and it worked at 24gb but iv learned mixing different ram brands can cause issues and lower performance. But my pc still booted up, and ran pretty decent. But for some reason adding the same Vulcan Z”s 32gb with the 8gb ram did not boot up. At this point I was confused. Because it is so post to boot up, I ended up checking my motherboard website\nI was missing bios update 8.01 v2 1.2.0.8 apparently this update is for amd/ intel motherboards as well. It is so post to help with memory of your motherboard. So if you don’t have it please download it! A lot people that have gaming computers pre built just to game don’t know about bios updates. After removing one of the 16gb sticks and leaving the two 8gb sticks my pc finally booted up. I am still confused to the point where I don’t understand why it dose not boot up with both 16gb sticks and only one. I’m still getting my 32gb performance on my pc so I am happy with it. Now I just have one brand new 16gb ram stick collecting dust until i can figure out how to install it and get my 48Gb performance. Honestly I don’t know if it’s the company because i have seen a few reviews that these type of sticks are corrupted. So if you decide on buying Vulcan brand ram sticks good luck it might work and it might not work so your playing a dirty ball game :) hopefully if you missed this review before u bought the ram, and u have the same problem and u manage to find this an u try my methods explain above. An it helps YOUR WELCOME :)"

        "review": "This seems to be very good and affordable RAM. Looks like high quality Made in Taiwan. Worked right out of the box.\nI recommend.\nI ordered the MSi B450-A Max Pro motherboard when AM5 came out and paid around 80$ for it. A bit expensive but it is an ATX board. This RAM works with this motherboard right out of the box and is paired with an Ryzen 5900X. Super easy to install and flash with the BIOS button the Bios for the Ryzen 5000 series CPU's. Worked right out of the box. The board is better than the B450 board I have from Asus. Easy to install in my XPG Invader case.\nAt the beginning when freshly installed Windows 11 I got lots of sound problems. After installing the crap of MSi drivers and Utilities which actual version MSi's MSi Center was offering, my sound got messed up completely. Sound stutters becauso of the new sound drivers, Chipset drivers and the like. Headphones and 5.1 Speakers intermittently connected/disconnected causing delays and stutters. Looked like an software issue of MSi software. That foreced me to reinstall and erase from scrap Windows 10 and it offered then to upgrade to Windows 11. After that the problem was gone with only Windows drivers. Do not download the crap MSi Center offers. It can break your OS.\nOther than that this board suggests it has 2 full fledged PCIE x 16 slots of the 3.0 type. At least that is what customers will think easily. Think twice. It has only one x16 PCIE 3.0 slot and the long one below has x16 openings but only half of those have connector pins installed and the manual says it is not even an x8 slot but rather an x4 only. And to add insult to injury that slot is only 2.0. Completely misleading for an new buyer.\nOn the lower slot I have the GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi installed I had still from Q1 2020. It works on low settings on some games like HnG from 2016 and gets between 52 fps and 60 fps.\nOther than that this MSi board works way better than the Asus B450 board I have on my other system from last year. The RAM slots are way easier to use and the sticks slide into them like lubricated. The dual channel works on this board which is on my Asus most likely defective (Asus refuses warranty). I use it with 32 GB (2 x 16) TeamGroup TCreate RAM sticks. High quality 3200 Mhz sticks for relatively cheap.\nIt is a good strong board with 2 massive coolers on the Mosfets. These massive coolers impressed me as an new inexperienced buyer for my very first build. So it slipped to me the issue with the PCIE \"x16\" slots.\nThis Motherboard worked straight out of the box. I use the Ryzen 5900X with this with an Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 cooler. The coolers does not fit well the AM4 system since it's clip is way to stiff so I had to take the cooler off the CPU and bend a bit the clips till it fits just with a little pressure. Install the air coolers without too much pressure so it is not loose but can slide a bit is fine before snapping it gently in place. As original fit I got 66 Celsius to 70 Celsius on idle or doing basic work with that processor, but after bending the clips to aliviate the pressure I get now at the moment 51 Degrees Celsius. So if too much pressure is applied by the cooler onto the processor that rises the heat to a difference of about 20 Degrees Celsius. Any of these standard air coolers with heat pipes will be able to cool the Ryzen 5900X easily. While gaming it gets to about 61 degrees Celsius. My case has 3 fans in the front and 1 in the back.\nMSi's UEFI is a bit confusing if one is used to the Asus UEFI. But it has basically the same features but it is way more confusing. The fans can be adjusted better on MSi's BIOS. But with this 5900X duo deca core CPU, the PSU is annoyingly loud all the time. While on Ecomode with 65 Watts the whole system draws on gaming about 150 Watts. The board seems to have no problems to deliver power to the 5900X.\nRunning Cinebench with this board and 5900X CPU with settings to Ecomode 65Watt, the case fans kick in, the CPU has an temp of 61 Degrees Celsius after 5 Minutes Cinebench, the Mosfets have an temperature of 58 Degrees Celsius and the PCH has an temperature of 50 Celsius while the Cooler Master Silencio 120mm fan I put on the Gamma from GameMax CPU cooler, turns 1000 rpm and all 4 Arctic F12 120mm case fans show an rpm of 700.\nI am surprised how this GameMax Gamma air cooler is able to maintain cool this CPU. So the huge aluminum coolers on the Mosfets of the MSi board sure do their job.\nThe board has lots of fan headers. Thats very good.\nI recommend this board for the AM4 system but be aware of the cheating PCIE slot advertisement, the sound problems and the rather difficult to use UEFI settings. But this is an robust board."

I downloaded it then installed and went into set some different colors. There were some strange buttons that didn't show pictures but would pop up text as to either set, accept or delete profile.\nRegardless I set the Rams color that I liked and eventually my PC went to sleep, the Ram didn't turn off? After reading up it made sense as the RGB gets constant power from the 5 volt rail. Ok well there is a fix and that one was first I uninstalled and reinstalled the software and that fixed my menu issues, in fact the interfaced to the better as if it updated.\nTo set the Ram to go to sleep and turn off I applied this form the forum at Corsair.\n\nActually it is possible to disable the lighting for Corsair Vengeance RBG PRO RAM in iCUE.\n1. Open iCUE\n2. Click \"LIGHTING EFFECTS\" on the left panel\n3. Delete ALL lighting effects\n4. Click \"SETTINGS\" on the iCUE title bar\n5. Toggle \"Enable full software control\" to the opposite of what it was just on\n6. Click \"LIGHTING EFFECTS\" on the left panel again\n7. Delete ALL lighting effects\n8. Click \"SETTINGS\" on the iCUE title bar\n9. Make sure that the \"Enable full software control\" box indicates it is enabled, if not, enable it\n10. Click \"LIGHTING EFFECTS\" on the left panel again\n11. Customize your lighting effects at your discretion\n\nYou should now have disabled all lighting effects while your machine is asleep.\nVerify by putting computer to sleep.\n\nThis fixed mine and now I have been playing with various colors so it's all good! Excellent RAM!"

I'm planning to buy another pair at some point to fill the two remaining RAM slots. If you're thinking of buying this, and it's on sale, I'd definitely go for it as it offers great value for the money and looks superb.\nNow...\nOriginally it did get off to a worrying start as there was an issue with the product and didn't know if it was us or what. I spent a few hours diagnosing what the problem could've been, but I ended up having to request a replacement set to be sent & I also had to visit a shop 15 minutes away because the normal local shop I drop off to wasn't available to return the first set of RAM but ended up sending them off.\nLuckily, the replacement arrived fairly quickly. Great service from amazon!"

Pages open very nicely. But as I say I want to see the numbers accurately too. Overall so far a good buy. Very pleased."

Questo rende la Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO una scelta ideale per i giocatori che desiderano ottenere il massimo dalle loro sessioni di gioco e per gli utenti che lavorano con applicazioni impegnative dal punto di vista delle risorse, come la modellazione 3D e il rendering video.\n\nLa memoria Corsair è rinomata per la sua affidabilità e qualità costruttiva. I moduli sono realizzati con componenti di alta qualità e utilizzano un dissipatore di calore per mantenere le temperature sotto controllo anche durante carichi di lavoro intensi. Ciò aiuta a prevenire il surriscaldamento e assicura un funzionamento stabile e duraturo.\n\nUn altro aspetto positivo di questa memoria è la sua facilità di installazione. I moduli sono compatibili con la maggior parte delle schede madri DDR4 e possono essere installati rapidamente senza complicazioni. Inoltre, Corsair offre un'assistenza clienti solida e una garanzia limitata a vita sui suoi prodotti, fornendo una tranquillità aggiuntiva agli acquirenti.\n\nTuttavia, è importante notare che il prezzo di questa memoria potrebbe essere leggermente superiore rispetto a modelli simili senza illuminazione RGB. Quindi, se l'aspetto estetico non è una priorità per te, potresti considerare alternative più economiche. Inoltre, assicurati di verificare la compatibilità con la tua scheda madre prima di effettuare l'acquisto.\n\nIn definitiva, la Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO DDR4-RAM 3600 MHz 2x 8GB Memoria è una scelta solida per coloro che cercano prestazioni elevate, un'estetica personalizzabile e un'esperienza di gioco fluida. Con la sua potenza di elaborazione, affidabilità e illuminazione RGB accattivante, questa memoria si distingue come una scelta eccellente per gli appassionati di PC gaming e per gli utenti che richiedono elevate prestazioni dal loro sistema."

It should be noted that you CANNOT overclock this RAM. It runs at exactly the timings and FSB multiplier indicated, if you push it at all, you get instability and crashes.

This memory + a small SSD upgrade allowed the old machine to run windows 11 (yes 11 !). The laptop is an old HPDV6500 but with a little bit of tinkering as well as some debloater tools., it is now running a windows 11 home smoothly.\n\nThe memory came in a sealed retail packaging. Installation was fairly simple and replacing the existing 1+1 modules with these new 2+2GB modules improved the performance."

A few months later I upgraded the HDD with an SSD. It made a big difference. Over time and a few installed programs later it was starting to be less responsive and programs were taking longer to load.\n\nLooking through task manager I could see the total memory usage with several programs running was showing well over 70%. Thinking I might need a memory upgrade I did a little research and several people were saying some Dell computers were finicky with regards to RAM upgrades. One manufacturer in particular was recommended and said it was guaranteed to work but quite expensive at the same time.\n\nLong story short . . decided to purchase the TECMIYO 16GB (4x4) Kit based on its high user ratings. A couple days later the package arrived and the new RAM modules were installed. Everything went without a glitch and an overall easy upgrade. Happy to say my new old system is a lot snappier and responsive now and total memory usage is showing just over 40%. Highly recommend this RAM! Great price and works on a Dell 780 computer!"

(Screws did not strip the threaded holes.) A full size ATX motherboard fits. There is a 5.25 inch drive bay.\n\nThe bad: The 3.5 inch drive cage mounts at the bottom of the case right where it interferes with the USB3.0 socket on my motherboard. I had to mount the drive using the screw holes more forward in the case. The instructions are worthless. Mounting more than one 2.5 inch SSD would be very difficult.

        "review": "I'd like to preface by saying that it is a good quality pc case, especially for the price and the amount of space it gives you to work. One thing I must note is that my case fans all came installed as exhaust fans meaning there was no airflow coming into the pc. I was not able to make note of this until my pc was forcefully powered down, I'm assuming due to overheating the cpu during a game. If you setup the pc as it comes to you, you run the risk of suffocating your components which could lead to potential damage. Once the case fans are changed to an orientation that provides adequate airflow, it is not as authentically pleasing as it is advertised. Sure you can buy extra case fans for the top that can function as an intake, but there generally should be more intake than exhaust in a pc and four exhaust fans just is not acceptable. TLDR - beware when installing, all fans may be exhaust fans"

Games have never been attractive to me or to her, apart from her Daily Telegraph crossword puzzle.\n\nStrange, but I built the Windows machine using a 6-core AMD processor but it's still not compatible with Windows 11 because of the other two requirements, one of which requires hardware. Ah well, we'll stick with 10 until it goes away, then rebuild.\n\nI replaced the OS SSD as well, went from 128 GB SAMSUNG to 1TB SAMSUNG. It was only $10 more expensive than the 500 GB SAMSUNG SSD. SAMSUNG Magician was a breeze. It's so cool when software does exactly what it's supposed to do.I'm glad I purchased a Cooler Master case for her 10 years ago.

I turned off the RGB lights as well and no difference. Nothing works CAS settings wise except for CAS 22 which is the default, not XMP rating. CAS 22 memory running at 44C idle with fan on it. This is ridiculous. I've tested two kits of this memory now with same issue. This is the lowest bin Micron memory and should not be sold for Ryzen. With the GPU going this memory hits 55C and then memory tests indicate errors. memory package says max temp is 40C which is a joke and simply not doable. What a scam this Corsair memory is.

Leider macht Corsair nicht kenntlich ob es sich um dual oder single ranks handelt und so weiß man es nur mit software. Meine waren single ranks, was auf 1440p und höher den braten auch nicht mehr fett macht. Ich hab sie in mein neues B550 Tomahawk gepaart mit nem 5800x3D verbaut. Offiziell hab ich keine unterstützung für die Dimm-version gesehen aber die listen sind im besten fall veraltet. Sie wurden direkt anerkannt und laufen mindestens auf XMP1 mit 1800Mhz also 3600MT/s oder für alle die noch weniger ahnung haben als ich: \"3600 Mhz\" :) ..Was mir völlig reicht zum zocken und es scheint der sweet spot für einige AMD CPUs zu sein, vor allem sind die x3D chips sowieso weniger auf schnelle RAMs angewiesen dank riesigem L3 cache.\nDie RGB-beleuchtung ist hell und bieten dank iCUE software viele möglichkeiten auf individualisierung. Tipp: MSI software, die die beleuchtung regelt deinstallieren, sonst bleiben die auf einer farbe hängen unter iCUE.\nAlles in allem passable RAMs, wer auf dual ranks hofft kann gleich lotto spielen gehen oder wesentlich mehr bezahlen..oder eben 4x single ranks verbauen um dual rank zu erzwingen. Wie gesagt ab 1440p sowieso nicht wahrnehmbar."

Ram, PSU, PC case are all Corsair as are my peripherals and other equipment.\n\nEdit: despite performing well pc would crash constantly even though it would complete Cinebench tests. Memtestx86 revealed ram sticks to be faulty. Have returned. Evri the courier has collected returned item from the drop off point and have had returned product sitting in Evri warehouse for days at this point. Further delaying the return to Amazon, therefore further delaying the refund which will not be actioned until the product is in the Amazon distribution centrea. Only at that point can a refund be initiated according to Amazon. Then and only then I can be refunded and replace these ram sticks.\n\nUnfortunately sometimes these things happen. I have also favoured Amazon for PC Parts and have spent several thousands of GBP on pc parts from amazon this year alone. In future I will be using alternative parts suppliers as Amazon return time scales are an absolute joke.\n\nChanged the star rating to reflect the issues caused by the seller and the seller alone. Their return policies, their return time scales, their choice of return couriers.\n\nFor those of you that don't know Evri is the rebrand of Hermes who are notorious for delayed, missing and damaged goods."

However, iCue might be one of the worst software options for hardware. It's nice that you can set options you want and remove the software entirely, but if you want the lighting to turn off when your PC goes to sleep, you'll need the software installed. While I'm hoping that lighting controls for the RAM will be coming soon to Windows with the lighting control that has popped up in beta versions of Windows, but overall not much of a dealbreaker. I say that it'a such a bad thing due to how mnay resources iCue seems to use. While active, my CPU temps rise from anywhere between 2-8 degrees celsius, even while idle. For something that is only supposed to be controlling lights, it is an extremely high amount of usage for what it should be. But apart from that, I've seen no problems and it's been a really great set of RAM for the price."

Now this was me switching the rams around trying to figure out what was the problem. Because before I had some different brand name rams I mixed it with the Vulcan’s and it worked at 24gb but iv learned mixing different ram brands can cause issues and lower performance. But my pc still booted up, and ran pretty decent. But for some reason adding the same Vulcan Z”s 32gb with the 8gb ram did not boot up. At this point I was confused. Because it is so post to boot up, I ended up checking my motherboard website\nI was missing bios update 8.01 v2 1.2.0.8 apparently this update is for amd/ intel motherboards as well. It is so post to help with memory of your motherboard. So if you don’t have it please download it! A lot people that have gaming computers pre built just to game don’t know about bios updates. After removing one of the 16gb sticks and leaving the two 8gb sticks my pc finally booted up. I am still confused to the point where I don’t understand why it dose not boot up with both 16gb sticks and only one. I’m still getting my 32gb performance on my pc so I am happy with it. Now I just have one brand new 16gb ram stick collecting dust until i can figure out how to install it and get my 48Gb performance. Honestly I don’t know if it’s the company because i have seen a few reviews that these type of sticks are corrupted. So if you decide on buying Vulcan brand ram sticks good luck it might work and it might not work so your playing a dirty ball game :) hopefully if you missed this review before u bought the ram, and u have the same problem and u manage to find this an u try my methods explain above. An it helps YOUR WELCOME :)"

Compare this to other manufacturers who require you to produce a receipt and supply the vendor name, purchase date, etc. I very much appreciate the no-hassle RMA process and lifetime warranty of this RAM.\n\nThis RAM works great on a Gigabyte AB350-Gaming-CF board with a Ryzen 3 2200G processor, with an XMPP profile enabled in the firmware.

I may even pick up another 8x2 set for 32gb of ram total. Without massive Photoshop or video editing 16 is probably enough already, and anything over 32 is definitely overkill."

        "review": "This seems to be very good and affordable RAM. Looks like high quality Made in Taiwan. Worked right out of the box.\nI recommend.\nI ordered the MSi B450-A Max Pro motherboard when AM5 came out and paid around 80$ for it. A bit expensive but it is an ATX board. This RAM works with this motherboard right out of the box and is paired with an Ryzen 5900X. Super easy to install and flash with the BIOS button the Bios for the Ryzen 5000 series CPU's. Worked right out of the box. The board is better than the B450 board I have from Asus. Easy to install in my XPG Invader case.\nAt the beginning when freshly installed Windows 11 I got lots of sound problems. After installing the crap of MSi drivers and Utilities which actual version MSi's MSi Center was offering, my sound got messed up completely. Sound stutters becauso of the new sound drivers, Chipset drivers and the like. Headphones and 5.1 Speakers intermittently connected/disconnected causing delays and stutters. Looked like an software issue of MSi software. That foreced me to reinstall and erase from scrap Windows 10 and it offered then to upgrade to Windows 11. After that the problem was gone with only Windows drivers. Do not download the crap MSi Center offers. It can break your OS.\nOther than that this board suggests it has 2 full fledged PCIE x 16 slots of the 3.0 type. At least that is what customers will think easily. Think twice. It has only one x16 PCIE 3.0 slot and the long one below has x16 openings but only half of those have connector pins installed and the manual says it is not even an x8 slot but rather an x4 only. And to add insult to injury that slot is only 2.0. Completely misleading for an new buyer.\nOn the lower slot I have the GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi installed I had still from Q1 2020. It works on low settings on some games like HnG from 2016 and gets between 52 fps and 60 fps.\nOther than that this MSi board works way better than the Asus B450 board I have on my other system from last year. The RAM slots are way easier to use and the sticks slide into them like lubricated. The dual channel works on this board which is on my Asus most likely defective (Asus refuses warranty). I use it with 32 GB (2 x 16) TeamGroup TCreate RAM sticks. High quality 3200 Mhz sticks for relatively cheap.\nIt is a good strong board with 2 massive coolers on the Mosfets. These massive coolers impressed me as an new inexperienced buyer for my very first build. So it slipped to me the issue with the PCIE \"x16\" slots.\nThis Motherboard worked straight out of the box. I use the Ryzen 5900X with this with an Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 cooler. The coolers does not fit well the AM4 system since it's clip is way to stiff so I had to take the cooler off the CPU and bend a bit the clips till it fits just with a little pressure. Install the air coolers without too much pressure so it is not loose but can slide a bit is fine before snapping it gently in place. As original fit I got 66 Celsius to 70 Celsius on idle or doing basic work with that processor, but after bending the clips to aliviate the pressure I get now at the moment 51 Degrees Celsius. So if too much pressure is applied by the cooler onto the processor that rises the heat to a difference of about 20 Degrees Celsius. Any of these standard air coolers with heat pipes will be able to cool the Ryzen 5900X easily. While gaming it gets to about 61 degrees Celsius. My case has 3 fans in the front and 1 in the back.\nMSi's UEFI is a bit confusing if one is used to the Asus UEFI. But it has basically the same features but it is way more confusing. The fans can be adjusted better on MSi's BIOS. But with this 5900X duo deca core CPU, the PSU is annoyingly loud all the time. While on Ecomode with 65 Watts the whole system draws on gaming about 150 Watts. The board seems to have no problems to deliver power to the 5900X.\nRunning Cinebench with this board and 5900X CPU with settings to Ecomode 65Watt, the case fans kick in, the CPU has an temp of 61 Degrees Celsius after 5 Minutes Cinebench, the Mosfets have an temperature of 58 Degrees Celsius and the PCH has an temperature of 50 Celsius while the Cooler Master Silencio 120mm fan I put on the Gamma from GameMax CPU cooler, turns 1000 rpm and all 4 Arctic F12 120mm case fans show an rpm of 700.\nI am surprised how this GameMax Gamma air cooler is able to maintain cool this CPU. So the huge aluminum coolers on the Mosfets of the MSi board sure do their job.\nThe board has lots of fan headers. Thats very good.\nI recommend this board for the AM4 system but be aware of the cheating PCIE slot advertisement, the sound problems and the rather difficult to use UEFI settings. But this is an robust board."

The RGB lighting is gorgeous and syncs well with my motherboard. The performance is also top-notch, with fast speeds and low latency. The installation was easy, and the packaging was nice.\n\nThe only minor issue I have is that the RAM sticks are quite tall and they barely fit under my CPU cooler. I had to adjust the fan position a bit to make some room. It's not a big deal, but it would have been nice if they were a bit shorter or had a low-profile option.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this RAM to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish upgrade.

Otro punto que tampoco me ha gustado tiene que ver con el RGB, pierde la sincronización y cada memoria va por su lado, con el software ICUE se puede encontrar alguna configuración donde esto no moleste, pero uno de los cuatro módulos funcionaba al revés que los otros tres y no hubo manera de corregirlo, quizás la halla, pero yo no lo ve visto, cosa que le juega en contra, porque debería ser \"instalar y usar\", así de fácil. Después el diseño es muy bueno, a mi me ha encantado, en eso se lleva un Diez, y lástima lo del rgb porque creo que es uno de los más brillantes, uniformes y bonitos que he visto, es muy bueno el color de la luz. Quiero marcar como detalle no como defecto, que son muy altas, por lo que si el sócalo está muy cerca de procesador, el disipador chocará irremediablemente con la memoria, por lo tanto verificad ese detalle en el diseño de la placa base antes de comprarlas, con sistema de bomba eso no tiene importancia, pero con disipadores grandes si. En fin un gran producto que se queda corto al rematar su concepto, memoria de alto rendimiento que rinde discretamente, el mejor rgb que he visto en ram, pero que no tiene una buena sincronización y un diseño premium que enamora, pero que puede ser un problema con otro hardware, le daría un 8, si en estos días consigo sacarle más el jugo, le daré 5 estrellas y justificaré el porqué de ello.

Since I don't use multiple Microsoft Office Word/Excel files as it's slow and impossible with the current 2GB RAM.\n\nI thought I should have replaced my 500 GB HDD with a new 500 GB SSD. But after many online reads about this issue, I decided to enhance my 2GB RAM with an additional 8GB, 10 GB RAM in total. It perfectly fits the already 2nd existing slot size by DELL. I will keep my 2nd 8GB to increase the RAM for my work Dell PC/ Toshiba Laptop.\n\nAlso, I will consider replacing a new 500 GB SSD with my current 500 GB HDD which drains and affects the lifetime of my newly replaced DELL laptop 14.8V battery.\n\nThe laptop now works perfectly and as quick multitasking as I expected.\n\nRefer to YouTube or to my posted pictures below to have an idea of placing a new RAM, which I did by myself.\n\nFOR SAFETY: REMOVE THE LAPTOP BATTERY FIRST..\n\nTHANKS, TIMETEC AND AMAZON.."

Took the RAM usage from 80%+ to 20/30%.\nWhile it did help, the Optiplex is limited to 16gb RAM, so I set up weekly cache and file dumps, deleted apps I didn't use, disable several apps from booting on startup, all to help take as much strain off the system as I could.\nSwapping the harddrive to SSD would be the next biggest improvement but this was a fantastic upgrade for the price for a computer that sees mostly web surfing and some document editing.\nDo not game so I can't recommend it for that purpose."

        "review": "In looking to upgrade the RAM in my workstation, I came across many options: heat spreaders, RGB, etc..\nMy workstation, however, requires JEDEC memory modules, which limited my choices somewhat. Not that it matters, as my workstation's case does not have a clear side panel to see what's going on inside.\n\nI came across this Timetec Hynix 16 GB kit, and although I have never heard of Timetec, I have had Hynix based RAM in a couple of my previous workstations, and so decided to try this out.\n\nThe kit arrived in well packaged condition, seals intact and all.\n\nInstallation was fairly straight forward; remove old memory modules, align the notch of the new ones with the indentation on the memory module slots, and push into place.\n\nUpon initial power up of my workstation, I was greeted by a blank screen for a good 15 - 20 seconds. Although terrifying at first, I did not get any BIOS POST beep codes indicating RAM issues, so I decided to wait it out instead of hard powering off and on again. Shortly after, I was greeted (and relieved to see) Windows 10 starting up; I guess my workstation needed some time to initialize itself with the newly installed RAM.\n\nIn Windows 10 Task Manager, the newly installed RAM appears to be running at the correct speed of 2666 MHz. So far so good, and the performance gain of having 16 GB of RAM is very much noticeable.\n\nIt may not have any fancy head spreader, or fancy RGB, but if you are in need of JEDEC RAM, I would highly recommend Timetec Hynix."

        "review": "The delivery was prompt even during this Covid19 epidemic, even arriving a day earlier than I expected it to. Once it arrived, opening, unpacking the box, opening the package the RAM came in all took longer than the actual installation into my Acer Aspire desktop. All in all, it probably took less than 10 minutes from the time the delivery was dropped off to starting up the computer with the additional 16GB of memory.\n\nTo begin with I only had 1 stick of 16GB, so adding this doubled it to my computer's maximum of 32GB. Once installed, the boot-up time for my Debian-based Linux distro was noticeable quicker, as well as the time it took to automatically login. Furthermore there was a great increase in both the time it took to launch several apps along with running those several at the same time. For instance, prior to adding this RAM I was able to run several apps all at once, but each app made the computer lag a little bit more each time. Now I can run VLC, Firefox with YouTube playing, GIMP, Inkscape, my Terminal and Libreoffice without noticing any lag whatsoever.\n\nI won't lie, there's probably some better, faster RAM available, but since I don't play any games, this RAM is a great, budget-friendly addition which makes using my computer quicker and more reliable for everyday use, plus coding, watching videos, playing music, and graphic design here and there, and so on and so forth.\n\nIf you need some additional RAM for the uses I've described, this 16GB will suite your needs perfectly. I imagine the same is true if you need Timetec's other sizes like 4GB, 8Gb, and 32Gb, in both the desktop and laptop varieties. I don't think the make single sticks of more than 32GB, but they do make kits ranging from 1x4GB, 2x4GB, 4x4GB, 1x8GB, 4x8GB, all the way up to 8x16GB and 4x32GB, both of which would give you a whopping 128GB RAM.\n\nWhat's more all these various kits are quite reasonably priced. Like I said above, these may not be the top of the line when it comes to RAM like HyperX, Corsair, Patriot, or G.Skill, but at the end of the day all you need is budget-friendly, easy to install, and reliable memory, this Timetec Hynix IC 16GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM is a perfect fit. I also imagine the plethora of other kits made by Timetec will suit your needs for a good price and reliability as well!"

It took a lot of fiddling around and honestly I’m not sure exactly how I did it but I’ve finally managed to get the iCUE software that’s used to configure the RGB to register both RAMs and have the lighting work on both. When the software works it’s great, giving you the option to have different lighting for start up/idle (“hardware lighting”) and active (“lighting effects”), which you can see demonstrated in my video. You can individually configure each led light in terms of their colour and effect (which is how I created the ‘twinkling’ effect on mine), so you can really get creative. There’s also an option to link the lighting with other Corsair hardware you have, but I don’t have any so I can’t speak on how well that works. The problem is I had no lighting for a week and when I play around with it, it can just suddenly stop registering the ram for no reason. When it works, it’s lovely, but just be aware that it’s fickle.\n\nPC specs:\nMobo: ASUS ROG STRIX B760-A Gaming wifi\nGPU: Gigabyte NVIDIA Aero RTX 4070\nAIO: NZXT Kraken Elite RGB 360\nCPU: Intel i5 13600KF\nRAM: Corsair 32GB DDR5 RGB\nFans: Lian Li S120 infinity x6\nStrimer: Lian Li 24pin rgb strimer"

It was always quick to boot up and run but the apps and browsers were always a little sluggish but not any more! Apps like Office 2021 pop open in a few seconds compared to stalling for 15 secs some times! Chrome pops open and surfs so fast! I am not a gamer but I want things to run fast and now I got that!\n\nI was a little concerned when the package arrived from Amazon because it was in a large brown envelope and the 4 sticks inside were loose with no packing material to protect the plastic packages each stick was in but I installed it and voila! I made an PC I built in 2009 just as fast as todays i7’s! The RAM was on sale for two sticks totalling 16g’s for $55 so for $110, I got myself a faster PC!\n\nI took the 2-year warranty because I never heard of the brand name so I wanted some protection after the 30 days Amazon return expired!\n\nI am very happy with the product and recommend it!"

        "review": "This works with the Dell model 3470/3471 Small Form Factor desktop. I have total 24 GB RAM but managed to use only about 49% of the total installed RAM with this system. So total 24 GB installed RAM is probably a little overdoing for normal entertainment applications and some light gaming. This system is for sure future proof. Since RAM pricing was about 30$ for an 8 GB stick and an 2R 16 GB stick was 53$, then my reasoning was why not go directly with the 16 GB RAM (2400 Mhz) stick? Since the machine has anyways only 2 RAM slots and former pricing was over 100$ for an 16 GB RAM stick. The amount of RAM should be now future proof for about at least 10 to 20 years since my 8 year old Dell laptop had back then 8 GB of RAM as well as did this new machine come with 8 years later. I am sure in 10 years machines will not need 24 GB of RAM and the quad core processor is up to date as well as did my quad core processor of the 8 year old laptop. Heck, even an 15 year old Sony W. Vista 1.8 Ghz core 2 duo processor is as snappy with Windows 10, only 2 GB of RAM and an new SSD as any new computer today - no measurable difference. As far as I understand this Memory is made by SK Hynix in Taiwan. For this Dell model best is to go with an RAM stick which has no heat sink since it's an SFF desktop.\nI recommend this brand and particular RAM stick for this particular Dell model."

This was as much to add more system RAM as it was to have 2 sticks of RAM in place so the processor would work in dual channel mode with the memory. AMD Ryzen processors do really well in dual channel mode, there can be a good boast in performance. This begs the question, why do stock gaming machine makers like DELL and HP ship 8gb and 16gb systems with only one stick of RAM instead of 2 sticks of smaller size (2x8gb = 16gb) and 2x4gb = 8gb)? I guess it makes it less expensive to upgrade RAM like I did (and less expensive for the computer maker), but for people who never touch the hardware inside their computers, they are missing out on some performance boost.\n\nAnyways, I matched up the Micron stick specs to this Hynix stick and it works perfectly together. CPU-Z program reports that it is running at 1197.1 MHz in dual channel, so that is 2400 MHz of lovely harmony.\n\nI also upgraded another stock gaming system with an 8gb Hynix stick earlier this week (HP Pavilion 690-024), and had great results, so I was confident that this memory maker Timetec makes very compatible memory. This is good, because Ryzen processors can be more finicky about RAM than Intel processors. Their lifetime warranty is also important, but knock on wood, I won't have to test that one out."

The internet is becoming far more advanced with each passing day, and because of this simple, low memory tasks of that past are no more. Mostly everything requires lots of RAM, so if you only have 8GB of RAM you know the pain...So, after pulling my last hair out waiting for Google Chrome to load a webpage I decided to finally see if my PC was able to upgrade the RAM. Sho nuf!! I had 8GB installed and was expandable to 16GB so the decision was a no brainer. First of all, I couldn't believe how cheap RAM was...I was expecting to pay an arm and a leg for some reason...Anyway, if you have working fingers and are able to unscrew screws then you can do this, it's that simple! I managed my way inside my PC and popped out the two child's play 4GB RAM and stuck in the two brand new 8GB sticks giving me 16 total GB. My PC absolutely FLIES now!! I'm so mad I didn't do this earlier. It was so easy, so cheap, and the instant performance is unreal. Once you get the RAM installed in their slot, there is nothing else to do the PC software instantly recognizes the new RAM and takes over from there. I can't recommend doing RAM upgrade, especially for us lowly 8GB RAM plebes. Just do it, do it! Upgrade *if possible* and thank me later!"

When I enabled DOCP, the system would repeatedly fail to POST before finally setting the RAM to default speed of 2133 MTS. I tried several times to manually overclock it well below the rated clock speed of 3600 MTS (including 3200, 3000, and 2800) but it failed each time. I finally relented and ran it at the stock 2133 MTS with no issues, including some benchmarks.\n\nWhen I replaced the 2400G with a Ryzen 7 5700G, the system booted up and overclocked the RAM to 3600 MTS with no issues. The benchmarks showed the expected high performance."

I normally check the maker's Qualified Vendors List (QVL) for RAM before I buy it, and this RAM model was not on it even though the Patriot make was listed. Many people said it probably would probably work so I bought it anyway given the price (which 10 years ago would have been sky high). I had to seat it a couple of times before it would work. So if your computer doesn't boot, try one stick at a time to check each one. Then try seating it a couple times. Even a bit of dust or extra pressure might make a difference. This motherboard has color coded slots for dual-channel memory which is where it is supposed to go for just 2 sticks (vs 4). For regular computer usage, most software works within 8GB of RAM. But if you try some heavier-duty applications or games you will notice it uses as much RAM as it can get. World of Warcraft for example used upwards of 65% of the 16GM RAM after a while. I also dual-boot into Ubuntu Linux and with 16GB it just doesn't use any swap space at all. Quality brand. Nice heatsinks."

Patriot is a known and we'll regarded ram brand, I was amazed that I could get 16gb for so little money yet with a full size heat sink! Fantastic.\n\nNow a word about fitting these. I already had a pair of 8gb ram sticks installed from a decade ago when I first built my pc. These were 1600mhz corsairs. So fitting additional pair of 16gb patriots sticks also 1600mhz would be fine? Not so easy... If I removed the old sticks and inserted the new ones it worked. If I then added the old ones the pc kept shutting down. If however I installed the new patriot sticks in the second tier slots and the old corsairs in the primary slots it worked, but the motherboard down graded the clock speed to 1333mhz! A quick check revealed that the cas and latency of the old ram wasn't as fast as the new ones, even though they were all 1600mhz. Then I discovered the difference between jdec and xmp protocols. Basically the bios has xmp off by default. Turning this on allows the motherboard to operate the ram using the proper xmp profiles for each stick, so now they are all running at 1600mhz directly. In fact just switching on xmp gave my pc a 10% frame rate boost! Lesson learnt, turn on xmp if you have compliant ram sticks!"

EXCELLENT choice for a budget gaming PC. @ 32gigs of RAM (16GB Upgrade) and an i5 6th gen. Cost about $375 CAD, all in. Plays everything at Medium default setting. Now pumps out Ultra settings with MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE 60fps - 120fps, on recent 2018+ games.\nMy fave part though is when Vtech is Fully enabled and TPM is there, The windows RTE will fully suspend and crash, (once). While the Vtech keeps the foreground screaming at 2K (intel integrated GPU) uninterrupted. I'm just trying to say that, had I started with a \"Gaming\" foundation, rather than an extremely stable, \"always on\" business class, with SFF Sleeper case. I saved myself bout $500 with the added physical chip which will 100% deny ALL malicious access to chipset. For $0 🫡"

I got a ryzen 5600x cpu I recently had 16gb of this ram, then I decided to get the 32gb version of it. My motherboard max ram is 64Gb adding it up I was basically installing 48Gb all together. But for some reason when I add the two 16gb sticks with the two 8gb sticks, my computer for some reason would not boot up. Now this was me switching the rams around trying to figure out what was the problem. Because before I had some different brand name rams I mixed it with the Vulcan’s and it worked at 24gb but iv learned mixing different ram brands can cause issues and lower performance. But my pc still booted up, and ran pretty decent. But for some reason adding the same Vulcan Z”s 32gb with the 8gb ram did not boot up. At this point I was confused. Because it is so post to boot up, I ended up checking my motherboard website\nI was missing bios update 8.01 v2 1.2.0.8 apparently this update is for amd/ intel motherboards as well. It is so post to help with memory of your motherboard. So if you don’t have it please download it! A lot people that have gaming computers pre built just to game don’t know about bios updates. After removing one of the 16gb sticks and leaving the two 8gb sticks my pc finally booted up. I am still confused to the point where I don’t understand why it dose not boot up with both 16gb sticks and only one. I’m still getting my 32gb performance on my pc so I am happy with it. Now I just have one brand new 16gb ram stick collecting dust until i can figure out how to install it and get my 48Gb performance. Honestly I don’t know if it’s the company because i have seen a few reviews that these type of sticks are corrupted. So if you decide on buying Vulcan brand ram sticks good luck it might work and it might not work so your playing a dirty ball game :) hopefully if you missed this review before u bought the ram, and u have the same problem and u manage to find this an u try my methods explain above. An it helps YOUR WELCOME :)"

Worked right out of the box.\nI recommend.\nI ordered the MSi B450-A Max Pro motherboard when AM5 came out and paid around 80$ for it. A bit expensive but it is an ATX board. This RAM works with this motherboard right out of the box and is paired with an Ryzen 5900X. Super easy to install and flash with the BIOS button the Bios for the Ryzen 5000 series CPU's. Worked right out of the box. The board is better than the B450 board I have from Asus. Easy to install in my XPG Invader case.\nAt the beginning when freshly installed Windows 11 I got lots of sound problems. After installing the crap of MSi drivers and Utilities which actual version MSi's MSi Center was offering, my sound got messed up completely. Sound stutters becauso of the new sound drivers, Chipset drivers and the like. Headphones and 5.1 Speakers intermittently connected/disconnected causing delays and stutters. Looked like an software issue of MSi software. That foreced me to reinstall and erase from scrap Windows 10 and it offered then to upgrade to Windows 11. After that the problem was gone with only Windows drivers. Do not download the crap MSi Center offers. It can break your OS.\nOther than that this board suggests it has 2 full fledged PCIE x 16 slots of the 3.0 type. At least that is what customers will think easily. Think twice. It has only one x16 PCIE 3.0 slot and the long one below has x16 openings but only half of those have connector pins installed and the manual says it is not even an x8 slot but rather an x4 only. And to add insult to injury that slot is only 2.0. Completely misleading for an new buyer.\nOn the lower slot I have the GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi installed I had still from Q1 2020. It works on low settings on some games like HnG from 2016 and gets between 52 fps and 60 fps.\nOther than that this MSi board works way better than the Asus B450 board I have on my other system from last year. The RAM slots are way easier to use and the sticks slide into them like lubricated. The dual channel works on this board which is on my Asus most likely defective (Asus refuses warranty). I use it with 32 GB (2 x 16) TeamGroup TCreate RAM sticks. High quality 3200 Mhz sticks for relatively cheap.\nIt is a good strong board with 2 massive coolers on the Mosfets. These massive coolers impressed me as an new inexperienced buyer for my very first build. So it slipped to me the issue with the PCIE \"x16\" slots.\nThis Motherboard worked straight out of the box. I use the Ryzen 5900X with this with an Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 cooler. The coolers does not fit well the AM4 system since it's clip is way to stiff so I had to take the cooler off the CPU and bend a bit the clips till it fits just with a little pressure. Install the air coolers without too much pressure so it is not loose but can slide a bit is fine before snapping it gently in place. As original fit I got 66 Celsius to 70 Celsius on idle or doing basic work with that processor, but after bending the clips to aliviate the pressure I get now at the moment 51 Degrees Celsius. So if too much pressure is applied by the cooler onto the processor that rises the heat to a difference of about 20 Degrees Celsius. Any of these standard air coolers with heat pipes will be able to cool the Ryzen 5900X easily. While gaming it gets to about 61 degrees Celsius. My case has 3 fans in the front and 1 in the back.\nMSi's UEFI is a bit confusing if one is used to the Asus UEFI. But it has basically the same features but it is way more confusing. The fans can be adjusted better on MSi's BIOS. But with this 5900X duo deca core CPU, the PSU is annoyingly loud all the time. While on Ecomode with 65 Watts the whole system draws on gaming about 150 Watts. The board seems to have no problems to deliver power to the 5900X.\nRunning Cinebench with this board and 5900X CPU with settings to Ecomode 65Watt, the case fans kick in, the CPU has an temp of 61 Degrees Celsius after 5 Minutes Cinebench, the Mosfets have an temperature of 58 Degrees Celsius and the PCH has an temperature of 50 Celsius while the Cooler Master Silencio 120mm fan I put on the Gamma from GameMax CPU cooler, turns 1000 rpm and all 4 Arctic F12 120mm case fans show an rpm of 700.\nI am surprised how this GameMax Gamma air cooler is able to maintain cool this CPU. So the huge aluminum coolers on the Mosfets of the MSi board sure do their job.\nThe board has lots of fan headers. Thats very good.\nI recommend this board for the AM4 system but be aware of the cheating PCIE slot advertisement, the sound problems and the rather difficult to use UEFI settings. But this is an robust board."

I tried it in several amd boards ranging from b450's through x570's. Non of the had this ram on their QVL, but XMP/EXPO/DOCP all worked correctly on every board I tried it on. MSI, Asus, and several Gigabyte boards.\n\nI ended up sticking it in my workshop computer. Simple Asus x570 tuf gaming plus wi-fi, running a Ryzen 7 5700g. Since the rig uses the on board IGP of the 5700g, it uses the system ram for video memory. The fastest you can put in helps, and this 4000 speed ram gets the job done at a great price."

The RGB lighting is gorgeous and syncs well with my motherboard. The performance is also top-notch, with fast speeds and low latency. The installation was easy, and the packaging was nice.\n\nThe only minor issue I have is that the RAM sticks are quite tall and they barely fit under my CPU cooler. I had to adjust the fan position a bit to make some room. It's not a big deal, but it would have been nice if they were a bit shorter or had a low-profile option.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this RAM to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish upgrade. I give it 4/5 stars."

        "review": "First off I would like to say I’ve used other HDhomeruns in the past, a duo and a quattro. The Flex 4k is the next step.\nThe ATSC 3.0 standard is solid compared to ATSC 1.0\nI was getting some fringe channels from Michigan across Lake Huron this past week through tropospheric ducting and while 1.0 channels weren’t available after a bit, the 3.0 channels stayed solid. I watched some NHL playoffs on ABC because I could.\nThe ATSC 3.0 channels look great and the lower bit rate shows that even using the HEVC codec makes video look sharp.\nThe only downside was getting the audio codec for my pc, but once I got the codec it was all systems go.\nI have yet to try this with a firestick, but I would assume it would be great. As some of you know this is a network tuner. It’ll only play through an app or if you’re tech savvy you can take the channel stream and use many other programs to run the video stream.\nHooking it up is simple. Plug in the antenna in the coax input, plug an Ethernet rj45 cable in the Ethernet port. Plug in the power supply.\nDownload the software, update the firmware, run a channel scan and you’re good to go.\nLuckily I haven’t come across any of the channels that have DRM, but as far as I know SiliconDust is aware and it should be fixed with a firmware update.\nI use NextPVR to record any ATSC 1.0 channel, there isn’t anything besides the HDHomeRun app that can record the 3.0 channels, but you have to pay for that service (and I don’t know if it’s available in Canada).\nThis review is longer than anticipated, but I feel like I have so much to talk about.\nHope this helps other customers trying to cut the cord."

Although HDHomeRun can detect these channels, you will NOT be able to watch them.\n3) As far as I know there are no Canadian stations that currently broadcast in ATSC 3.0 at the moment.\n\nI don't think there is anything wrong with the device itself but the issue lies with the DRM encryption the broadcasters are using and also the fact that NONE of the Canadian broadcasters use ATSC 3.0 at this time.\n\nSummary, if you live close enough to the US border, you might be able to pick up a few 4k channels but not all of them will be accessible. If you do not live anywhere close to the US border, you might not get any 4k channels at all.\n\nHopefully broadcasters abandon the DRM encryption and more Canadian companies implement ATSC 3.0 in the near future."

I received my Flex 4K and it was installed in less than 15 minutes to install the hardware. I use the HDHomeRun app on my Apple TV, my LG TV, MacBook and Windows computers. It was very easy to install the software and picked up ATSC 1.0 and 3.0 channels in the area.\n\nI was able to watch the television channels using any device but after a week, the product failed as it could not pick up a signal from my antenna and all of the channels were lost. I attempted to complete multiple channel scans to no avail. After working with their technical support who attempted to diagnose my technical logs off of my device for 3 days, I ended up having to return my Flex 4K to SiliconDust for a replacement. I received my new Flex 4K within 48 hours of letting me know that a replacement would be provided.\n\nMy replacement Flex 4K works fine. I find that the Flex 4K generally picks up the ATSC 3.0 channels without issue, but there are times where no sound is available or other times no signal is picked up. I find that I have to switch over to a ATSC 1.0 channel, then return to the ATSC 3.0 channel for the signal to be picked up. The Flex 4K picks up ATSC 1.0 channels without issue. I have not tried the USB port to attach a portable hard drive to the Flex 4K to enable the DVR features yet, but it is something that I plan to do shortly.\n\nI notice that SiliconDust has been working on improving the firmware, so I hope that they continue to make frequent updates to improve the performance of the Flex 4K especially with the performance of the ATSC 3.0 channels. I also hope that they will make some changes to the LG app to take advantage of using the smart remote to be able to change channels with numeric pad rather than having to using the remote to pick the channel.\n\nI think despite some of the issues that I have identified here, I have no regrets in picking up the Flex 4K."

I did not have to find the ip or anything, it just started on my network on it’s own.\nI then did a channel scan and it did that. I selected a couple of options to send back diagnostic reports and be part of beta software. The tuners are more sensitive than my tv tuners so a got a few more stations. I set it up on my 3 Nvidia Shields, 2 Apple TV boxes and a PC running win 11. All without difficulty.

Il venditore, la stessa casa produttrice è stato disponibilissimo nel verificare se il Kit era compatibile con la mia scheda madre (Asus P8z68-M PRO) sulla quale avevo 4 banchi di RAM da 4 GB devo dire che il raddoppio mi ha permesso di utilizzare con ottima fluidità Light Room e Photoshop contemporaneamente. Consiglio a chiunque abbia un vecchio sistema come il mio (con più di 10 anni di onorato servizio ormai) di ampliare la RAM e visto il prezzo di queste Timetec farete un discreto upgrade ad un ottimo prezzo.

Got this for an old Win10 streaming box (AMD Phenom x4 965) that was getting by with just 4gb of RAM. 16gb is far more than what I needed for this PC's intended purpose, but the price was even cheaper than most 2x4gb or 2x8gb pairs. Booted up just fine with no memory tuning necessary in the BIOS. What surprised me was that CAS defaulted to 1T, which is faster than some of the other premium DD3 sticks I'm used. Am going to order an additional pair for another AMD Phenom x6 1055T box that currently has only 8gb (4x2gb) of RAM."

Literally cant beat the price for new RAM, as this was about $40USD after tax.\nIt is perhaps a bit of overkill on my system to bump it to 32 from 8 gbs of ram, and certainly inst helping Sims 4 run any better on it despite a healthy video card pushing it.\nRegardless, the sticks have been running without any hassle for the past month, so I think I am in the clear on getting defective chips.\nI wish I could say I see noticeable improvement, but I don't push my system hard enough to see their limitations. Which I suppose is the entire point of upgrading the RAM this much, so unless I can find some ultra technical tweaks to enhance their performance through settings, this little engine is gonna be as fast as it is ever gonna be.\nTL;DR - It seems to do what it says on the tin."

But the Crucial Ram, although basic and only running at 4800 MHz is a steal and does a great job, produces excellent results. I had a few issues getting my new Z690 system to boot and it did turn out to be the memory but there was nothing wrong with the Crucial ram, it just had to be reseated a few times in the MoBo, which was not the fault of the ram. I am very happy I found these UDIMMs, otherwise I don't think my new system would be running today. They turned out be a real steal."

The cooler is so large the front fan sits on top of the RAM. This RAM is the lowest profile DDR5 quality (Hynix) RAM I could find at 6000MHz with a CAS Latency of 30. The others are either slower, higher latency or higher profile. Check that you have the latest BIOS as the RAM's rated voltage of 1.35 will be activated when you turn on EXPO. That is quite close to the SOC danger zone of 1.4V+, you need the new BIOS with built in safeguards.\nThe only downside if you are in the UK is that it ships from New Jersey, for me it took 9 days to arrive."

(DO AT YOUR OWN RISK)"

        "review": "So when I got the ram I ended up spending like 1 to about two hours trying to install it. I got a asrock b450 pro4 board. I got a ryzen 5600x cpu I recently had 16gb of this ram, then I decided to get the 32gb version of it. My motherboard max ram is 64Gb adding it up I was basically installing 48Gb all together. But for some reason when I add the two 16gb sticks with the two 8gb sticks, my computer for some reason would not boot up. Now this was me switching the rams around trying to figure out what was the problem. Because before I had some different brand name rams I mixed it with the Vulcan’s and it worked at 24gb but iv learned mixing different ram brands can cause issues and lower performance. But my pc still booted up, and ran pretty decent. But for some reason adding the same Vulcan Z”s 32gb with the 8gb ram did not boot up. At this point I was confused. Because it is so post to boot up, I ended up checking my motherboard website\nI was missing bios update 8.01 v2 1.2.0.8 apparently this update is for amd/ intel motherboards as well. It is so post to help with memory of your motherboard. So if you don’t have it please download it! A lot people that have gaming computers pre built just to game don’t know about bios updates. After removing one of the 16gb sticks and leaving the two 8gb sticks my pc finally booted up. I am still confused to the point where I don’t understand why it dose not boot up with both 16gb sticks and only one. I’m still getting my 32gb performance on my pc so I am happy with it. Now I just have one brand new 16gb ram stick collecting dust until i can figure out how to install it and get my 48Gb performance. Honestly I don’t know if it’s the company because i have seen a few reviews that these type of sticks are corrupted. So if you decide on buying Vulcan brand ram sticks good luck it might work and it might not work so your playing a dirty ball game :) hopefully if you missed this review before u bought the ram, and u have the same problem and u manage to find this an u try my methods explain above. An it helps YOUR WELCOME :)"

        "review": "This seems to be very good and affordable RAM. Looks like high quality Made in Taiwan. Worked right out of the box.\nI recommend.\nI ordered the MSi B450-A Max Pro motherboard when AM5 came out and paid around 80$ for it. A bit expensive but it is an ATX board. This RAM works with this motherboard right out of the box and is paired with an Ryzen 5900X. Super easy to install and flash with the BIOS button the Bios for the Ryzen 5000 series CPU's. Worked right out of the box. The board is better than the B450 board I have from Asus. Easy to install in my XPG Invader case.\nAt the beginning when freshly installed Windows 11 I got lots of sound problems. After installing the crap of MSi drivers and Utilities which actual version MSi's MSi Center was offering, my sound got messed up completely. Sound stutters becauso of the new sound drivers, Chipset drivers and the like. Headphones and 5.1 Speakers intermittently connected/disconnected causing delays and stutters. Looked like an software issue of MSi software. That foreced me to reinstall and erase from scrap Windows 10 and it offered then to upgrade to Windows 11. After that the problem was gone with only Windows drivers. Do not download the crap MSi Center offers. It can break your OS.\nOther than that this board suggests it has 2 full fledged PCIE x 16 slots of the 3.0 type. At least that is what customers will think easily. Think twice. It has only one x16 PCIE 3.0 slot and the long one below has x16 openings but only half of those have connector pins installed and the manual says it is not even an x8 slot but rather an x4 only. And to add insult to injury that slot is only 2.0. Completely misleading for an new buyer.\nOn the lower slot I have the GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi installed I had still from Q1 2020. It works on low settings on some games like HnG from 2016 and gets between 52 fps and 60 fps.\nOther than that this MSi board works way better than the Asus B450 board I have on my other system from last year. The RAM slots are way easier to use and the sticks slide into them like lubricated. The dual channel works on this board which is on my Asus most likely defective (Asus refuses warranty). I use it with 32 GB (2 x 16) TeamGroup TCreate RAM sticks. High quality 3200 Mhz sticks for relatively cheap.\nIt is a good strong board with 2 massive coolers on the Mosfets. These massive coolers impressed me as an new inexperienced buyer for my very first build. So it slipped to me the issue with the PCIE \"x16\" slots.\nThis Motherboard worked straight out of the box. I use the Ryzen 5900X with this with an Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 cooler. The coolers does not fit well the AM4 system since it's clip is way to stiff so I had to take the cooler off the CPU and bend a bit the clips till it fits just with a little pressure. Install the air coolers without too much pressure so it is not loose but can slide a bit is fine before snapping it gently in place. As original fit I got 66 Celsius to 70 Celsius on idle or doing basic work with that processor, but after bending the clips to aliviate the pressure I get now at the moment 51 Degrees Celsius. So if too much pressure is applied by the cooler onto the processor that rises the heat to a difference of about 20 Degrees Celsius. Any of these standard air coolers with heat pipes will be able to cool the Ryzen 5900X easily. While gaming it gets to about 61 degrees Celsius. My case has 3 fans in the front and 1 in the back.\nMSi's UEFI is a bit confusing if one is used to the Asus UEFI. But it has basically the same features but it is way more confusing. The fans can be adjusted better on MSi's BIOS. But with this 5900X duo deca core CPU, the PSU is annoyingly loud all the time. While on Ecomode with 65 Watts the whole system draws on gaming about 150 Watts. The board seems to have no problems to deliver power to the 5900X.\nRunning Cinebench with this board and 5900X CPU with settings to Ecomode 65Watt, the case fans kick in, the CPU has an temp of 61 Degrees Celsius after 5 Minutes Cinebench, the Mosfets have an temperature of 58 Degrees Celsius and the PCH has an temperature of 50 Celsius while the Cooler Master Silencio 120mm fan I put on the Gamma from GameMax CPU cooler, turns 1000 rpm and all 4 Arctic F12 120mm case fans show an rpm of 700.\nI am surprised how this GameMax Gamma air cooler is able to maintain cool this CPU. So the huge aluminum coolers on the Mosfets of the MSi board sure do their job.\nThe board has lots of fan headers. Thats very good.\nI recommend this board for the AM4 system but be aware of the cheating PCIE slot advertisement, the sound problems and the rather difficult to use UEFI settings. But this is an robust board."

Since the rig uses the on board IGP of the 5700g, it uses the system ram for video memory. The fastest you can put in helps, and this 4000 speed ram gets the job done at a great price."

The RGB lighting is gorgeous and syncs well with my motherboard. The performance is also top-notch, with fast speeds and low latency. The installation was easy, and the packaging was nice.\n\nThe only minor issue I have is that the RAM sticks are quite tall and they barely fit under my CPU cooler. I had to adjust the fan position a bit to make some room. It's not a big deal, but it would have been nice if they were a bit shorter or had a low-profile option.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this RAM to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish upgrade. I give it 4/5 stars."

        "review": "I got this to use in Dell optiplex that supports up to 1333MHz memory. In one of the Amazon \"questions\" a person asks if you can overclock this memory. A teamgroup representative tells them you can't over clock it...or under clock it. They said you must buy the ram that runs at the native speed you require. While it's perhaps true that this isn't the best ram to try to over clock, I'm sure this memory will under clock (run at a lower MHz) just fine.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't see that the manual for my PC states that it can only support dimms in 1GB, 2GB, and 4GB sizes for a total of 8GB (it has two slots). While the CPU itself supports up to 32GB, it seems that the motherboard does not. Oddly enough it actually recognized the full 16GB. The memory clocked down to 1333MHz 9CL. The OS booted up. It would even pass 2 rounds of memtest86. Sadly it would always crash the PC on the third pass of memtest86.\n\nThe memory itself was perfectly fine. I ended up using it in another system that supports both 1600MHz and 32GB. I used two kits of two for a total of 32GB (4x16GB). A teamgroup rep will also probably tell you that you can't mix two identical but separate kits, but it completed 6 passes of memtest86 with flying monochromatic colors. Is 32GB overkill for a 4th gen PC? Probably...but at this price, why not?\n\nIt's nice that these are black instead of green or blue just on the off chance you're upgrading your old 2014 gaming rig with plexiglass side panel. Obviously these don't have RGB, but neither does the PC you're using them in."

So I was very disappointed to notice no speed increase at all after installing the two sticks of 8GB. Thinking something was wrong, I looked again and learned that the motherboard had been using dual-channel for 4GB across both sticks (8GB total) and single-channel for the remaining 4GB on the second stick - so this is why I hadn't noticed a huge speed increase...... Of course, this is my own fault - but I am happy to have 16GB now - and if I go application heavy in the future then I'll appreciate having dual-channel across 16GB! Product arrived on-time, and in good shape.\n\nI have always bought Crucial memory as I've never had any problem with previous purchases, the products come with a decent warranty, and they guarantee it'll work with the computer so long as you use their application prior to purchasing. So took screen shots to prove that I had tested it prior to purchasing - knowing that I could return it if it didn't perform as expected. It's a pretty easy system to use."

I used this as a quick cheap option to test a DDR4 motherboard I got my hands on that I wasn't really ready for, and had no memory on hand to test the motherboard with. It's pretty slow and has difficulty even just running Windows 11 processes, but at the end of the day it's a single stick of low speed 8GB memory that didn't even cost 20 bucks. Saves me from having to drop 100+ dollars on a set of decent gaming memory before I even know the motherboard works, and now it can go into the box of spare/test parts for later. TL;DR, you won't be doing any hardcore gaming on this stick but it works for quick and cheap testing or maybe if all you do on your PC is data entry or emails."

Faster IS better too if you can afford it, BUT, in Ram, you really want QUANTITY even more than speed.\n\nThis is non RGB Ram, nothing really fancy, but it looks nice & is a clean design that won't break your pocket book.\n\nSpeeds & timings are a little on the slower side but specs are good & everything works as it should.\n\nRam is usually something that goes bad years down the road if it DOES go bad, or unless you get a bad stick out of the box which is rare, so only time will tell on the durability of this Ram. But it's good out of the gate as it were.\nHas a 5 year warranty if you have any issues with yours.\n\n2 sticks of 8gb, a total of 16gb of Ram is enough for most every day uses & PC's. Even 8gb is usually adequate. The less Ram you have though, the faster it will \"fill up\" & the more you will need to do a full restart to clear it so your PC doesn't slow down.\n\n16gb is a good place to start as far as capacity. I always like to get a MoBo that has 4 slots for Ram though, and start with filling 2 of the slots with half the capacity of the MoBo, and then you have the option to double that later on with matched Ram. ...It's really best to not mix & match Ram BTW. Try to get the same kind & capacity sizes when you do add some. At least be sure you match the timings to prevent issues.\n\nThis is good Ram though, especially if you're on a tighter budget."

        "review": "In looking to upgrade the RAM in my workstation, I came across many options: heat spreaders, RGB, etc..\nMy workstation, however, requires JEDEC memory modules, which limited my choices somewhat. Not that it matters, as my workstation's case does not have a clear side panel to see what's going on inside.\n\nI came across this Timetec Hynix 16 GB kit, and although I have never heard of Timetec, I have had Hynix based RAM in a couple of my previous workstations, and so decided to try this out.\n\nThe kit arrived in well packaged condition, seals intact and all.\n\nInstallation was fairly straight forward; remove old memory modules, align the notch of the new ones with the indentation on the memory module slots, and push into place.\n\nUpon initial power up of my workstation, I was greeted by a blank screen for a good 15 - 20 seconds. Although terrifying at first, I did not get any BIOS POST beep codes indicating RAM issues, so I decided to wait it out instead of hard powering off and on again. Shortly after, I was greeted (and relieved to see) Windows 10 starting up; I guess my workstation needed some time to initialize itself with the newly installed RAM.\n\nIn Windows 10 Task Manager, the newly installed RAM appears to be running at the correct speed of 2666 MHz. So far so good, and the performance gain of having 16 GB of RAM is very much noticeable.\n\nIt may not have any fancy head spreader, or fancy RGB, but if you are in need of JEDEC RAM, I would highly recommend Timetec Hynix."

        "review": "The delivery was prompt even during this Covid19 epidemic, even arriving a day earlier than I expected it to. Once it arrived, opening, unpacking the box, opening the package the RAM came in all took longer than the actual installation into my Acer Aspire desktop. All in all, it probably took less than 10 minutes from the time the delivery was dropped off to starting up the computer with the additional 16GB of memory.\n\nTo begin with I only had 1 stick of 16GB, so adding this doubled it to my computer's maximum of 32GB. Once installed, the boot-up time for my Debian-based Linux distro was noticeable quicker, as well as the time it took to automatically login. Furthermore there was a great increase in both the time it took to launch several apps along with running those several at the same time. For instance, prior to adding this RAM I was able to run several apps all at once, but each app made the computer lag a little bit more each time. Now I can run VLC, Firefox with YouTube playing, GIMP, Inkscape, my Terminal and Libreoffice without noticing any lag whatsoever.\n\nI won't lie, there's probably some better, faster RAM available, but since I don't play any games, this RAM is a great, budget-friendly addition which makes using my computer quicker and more reliable for everyday use, plus coding, watching videos, playing music, and graphic design here and there, and so on and so forth.\n\nIf you need some additional RAM for the uses I've described, this 16GB will suite your needs perfectly. I imagine the same is true if you need Timetec's other sizes like 4GB, 8Gb, and 32Gb, in both the desktop and laptop varieties. I don't think the make single sticks of more than 32GB, but they do make kits ranging from 1x4GB, 2x4GB, 4x4GB, 1x8GB, 4x8GB, all the way up to 8x16GB and 4x32GB, both of which would give you a whopping 128GB RAM.\n\nWhat's more all these various kits are quite reasonably priced. Like I said above, these may not be the top of the line when it comes to RAM like HyperX, Corsair, Patriot, or G.Skill, but at the end of the day all you need is budget-friendly, easy to install, and reliable memory, this Timetec Hynix IC 16GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM is a perfect fit. I also imagine the plethora of other kits made by Timetec will suit your needs for a good price and reliability as well!"

        "review": "I recently acquired the CORSAIR Vengeance RGB PRO 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 3600 (PC4-28800) C18 Desktop Memory to pair with i5-13600K and 4080 FE, and I must say it has been an excellent addition to my PC setup. In this review, I will share my experience with this memory kit, focusing on its performance, aesthetics, and overall value.\n\nPerformance:\nThe CORSAIR Vengeance RGB PRO memory kit boasts impressive performance specifications. With a speed of DDR4 3600 and a CAS latency of 18, it delivers fast and responsive performance for demanding tasks. I noticed a significant improvement in overall system responsiveness, particularly when running resource-intensive applications and multitasking. The increased memory capacity of 32GB ensures smooth performance and effortless multitasking, even when dealing with large files or running memory-intensive software.\n\nAesthetics:\nThe standout feature of the CORSAIR Vengeance RGB PRO memory kit is its stunning RGB lighting. The individually addressable RGB LEDs on each module can be customized using the CORSAIR iCUE software, allowing for a wide range of lighting effects and color combinations. The lighting synchronization with other compatible CORSAIR products further enhances the overall aesthetic appeal, creating an immersive and visually striking setup. The sleek, low-profile design of the modules adds to their visual appeal and compatibility with most CPU coolers.\n\nBuild Quality and Durability:\nCORSAIR is well-known for its high-quality components, and the Vengeance RGB PRO memory kit lives up to that reputation. The modules are built with precision and attention to detail, ensuring long-lasting durability. The aluminum heat spreaders not only enhance the aesthetics but also contribute to effective heat dissipation, allowing for stable performance even during extended use. The sturdy construction of the modules provides confidence in their reliability.\n\nEasy Installation and Compatibility:\nInstalling the CORSAIR Vengeance RGB PRO memory kit was a breeze. The modules fit seamlessly into my motherboard's DIMM slots, and the XMP 2.0 support made it easy to set up and optimize the memory settings for maximum performance. The compatibility with a wide range of motherboards ensures that most users can benefit from this memory kit without any compatibility concerns.\n\nValue:\nWhile the CORSAIR Vengeance RGB PRO memory kit falls in the higher price range, it offers excellent value for enthusiasts and gamers seeking high-performance memory with captivating RGB lighting. The combination of impressive performance, eye-catching aesthetics, and reliable build quality justifies the investment for those who prioritize both style and functionality in their PC setup.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe CORSAIR Vengeance RGB PRO 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 3600 (PC4-28800) C18 Desktop Memory is a top-notch memory kit that delivers not only exceptional performance but also adds a touch of RGB brilliance to your PC build. With its impressive speed, ample capacity, customizable RGB lighting, and reliable build quality, this memory kit is a worthy upgrade for users looking to enhance their PC's performance and aesthetics.\n\nDisclaimer: I purchased the CORSAIR Vengeance RGB PRO 32GB DDR4 3600 Desktop Memory independently and did not receive it as part of any specific program or incentive. My review is solely based on my personal experience and observations with this memory kit."

It’s always on even if my PC is in sleep mode tho.\n\nOne major issue I noticed is when I first installed it, the task manager read it as 2133 MHz for speed instead of the 3600. I had to go into bios settings at startup and manually change them to 3600. After that they are reading as running at the 3600mhz they are supposed to be at. Other that that, easy peasy to install, just turn off PC, unplug old RAM and insert new RAM sticks, it’s as easy as that."

These are my second set to get me to 64BG and they work very well and are very fast. The RGB is a little of a pain to get programmed and sometimes they don't like to do what you ask so sometimes you have to reload it and redo it even when hardware setting them but at the end of the day you don't buy gaming ram for colours as the first priority! The iCue is the only downside which isnt a knock so much on the ram but at least if you have several iCue products you don't have too many programs to change different RGB options in your case."

I am currently running a Corsair Vengeance computer with an i7 11700 non k cpu, and a MSI Z490-A pro motherboard.\n\nOnce installed and set to XMP it gave me the overclock error. I dropped it to 3200 mhz and it booted fine with no problems since. I am running bios E7C751Z1.2CB, or 2.CB is how CPU Z reads it.\n\nIt should easily go higher, but I will have to play with the overclock settings and see how high I can get it to work while being stable. This kit is using Nanya chips, at least the sticks I have, which is fine.\n\nEven if it goes no higher, it has been a good upgrade from 16 gb. Things seem to run very smoothly and I have no problems running discord and surfing the web on my second monitor, while gaming on my main one. I have two 27\" MSI monitors side by side.\n\nThe rgb looks great, and since I have a Corsair Vengeance computer already it just worked right off the bat with my icue software.\n\nI feel much better about having 32 gbs of memory for my future PC games. I also know that, although I have no plans too, in the future if I upgrade or change the motherboard and possibly the cpu, I can still use this memory and it will work fine at its rated speed of 3600 mhz.\n\nI have no cons. Corsair makes great memory and other computer components, and this memory was a great value at this low of a price in the summer of 2023."

        "review": "So when I got the ram I ended up spending like 1 to about two hours trying to install it. I got a asrock b450 pro4 board. I got a ryzen 5600x cpu I recently had 16gb of this ram, then I decided to get the 32gb version of it. My motherboard max ram is 64Gb adding it up I was basically installing 48Gb all together. But for some reason when I add the two 16gb sticks with the two 8gb sticks, my computer for some reason would not boot up. Now this was me switching the rams around trying to figure out what was the problem. Because before I had some different brand name rams I mixed it with the Vulcan’s and it worked at 24gb but iv learned mixing different ram brands can cause issues and lower performance. But my pc still booted up, and ran pretty decent. But for some reason adding the same Vulcan Z”s 32gb with the 8gb ram did not boot up. At this point I was confused. Because it is so post to boot up, I ended up checking my motherboard website\nI was missing bios update 8.01 v2 1.2.0.8 apparently this update is for amd/ intel motherboards as well. It is so post to help with memory of your motherboard. So if you don’t have it please download it! A lot people that have gaming computers pre built just to game don’t know about bios updates. After removing one of the 16gb sticks and leaving the two 8gb sticks my pc finally booted up. I am still confused to the point where I don’t understand why it dose not boot up with both 16gb sticks and only one. I’m still getting my 32gb performance on my pc so I am happy with it. Now I just have one brand new 16gb ram stick collecting dust until i can figure out how to install it and get my 48Gb performance. Honestly I don’t know if it’s the company because i have seen a few reviews that these type of sticks are corrupted. So if you decide on buying Vulcan brand ram sticks good luck it might work and it might not work so your playing a dirty ball game :) hopefully if you missed this review before u bought the ram, and u have the same problem and u manage to find this an u try my methods explain above. An it helps YOUR WELCOME :)"

        "review": "This seems to be very good and affordable RAM. Looks like high quality Made in Taiwan. Worked right out of the box.\nI recommend.\nI ordered the MSi B450-A Max Pro motherboard when AM5 came out and paid around 80$ for it. A bit expensive but it is an ATX board. This RAM works with this motherboard right out of the box and is paired with an Ryzen 5900X. Super easy to install and flash with the BIOS button the Bios for the Ryzen 5000 series CPU's. Worked right out of the box. The board is better than the B450 board I have from Asus. Easy to install in my XPG Invader case.\nAt the beginning when freshly installed Windows 11 I got lots of sound problems. After installing the crap of MSi drivers and Utilities which actual version MSi's MSi Center was offering, my sound got messed up completely. Sound stutters becauso of the new sound drivers, Chipset drivers and the like. Headphones and 5.1 Speakers intermittently connected/disconnected causing delays and stutters. Looked like an software issue of MSi software. That foreced me to reinstall and erase from scrap Windows 10 and it offered then to upgrade to Windows 11. After that the problem was gone with only Windows drivers. Do not download the crap MSi Center offers. It can break your OS.\nOther than that this board suggests it has 2 full fledged PCIE x 16 slots of the 3.0 type. At least that is what customers will think easily. Think twice. It has only one x16 PCIE 3.0 slot and the long one below has x16 openings but only half of those have connector pins installed and the manual says it is not even an x8 slot but rather an x4 only. And to add insult to injury that slot is only 2.0. Completely misleading for an new buyer.\nOn the lower slot I have the GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi installed I had still from Q1 2020. It works on low settings on some games like HnG from 2016 and gets between 52 fps and 60 fps.\nOther than that this MSi board works way better than the Asus B450 board I have on my other system from last year. The RAM slots are way easier to use and the sticks slide into them like lubricated. The dual channel works on this board which is on my Asus most likely defective (Asus refuses warranty). I use it with 32 GB (2 x 16) TeamGroup TCreate RAM sticks. High quality 3200 Mhz sticks for relatively cheap.\nIt is a good strong board with 2 massive coolers on the Mosfets. These massive coolers impressed me as an new inexperienced buyer for my very first build. So it slipped to me the issue with the PCIE \"x16\" slots.\nThis Motherboard worked straight out of the box. I use the Ryzen 5900X with this with an Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 cooler. The coolers does not fit well the AM4 system since it's clip is way to stiff so I had to take the cooler off the CPU and bend a bit the clips till it fits just with a little pressure. Install the air coolers without too much pressure so it is not loose but can slide a bit is fine before snapping it gently in place. As original fit I got 66 Celsius to 70 Celsius on idle or doing basic work with that processor, but after bending the clips to aliviate the pressure I get now at the moment 51 Degrees Celsius. So if too much pressure is applied by the cooler onto the processor that rises the heat to a difference of about 20 Degrees Celsius. Any of these standard air coolers with heat pipes will be able to cool the Ryzen 5900X easily. While gaming it gets to about 61 degrees Celsius. My case has 3 fans in the front and 1 in the back.\nMSi's UEFI is a bit confusing if one is used to the Asus UEFI. But it has basically the same features but it is way more confusing. The fans can be adjusted better on MSi's BIOS. But with this 5900X duo deca core CPU, the PSU is annoyingly loud all the time. While on Ecomode with 65 Watts the whole system draws on gaming about 150 Watts. The board seems to have no problems to deliver power to the 5900X.\nRunning Cinebench with this board and 5900X CPU with settings to Ecomode 65Watt, the case fans kick in, the CPU has an temp of 61 Degrees Celsius after 5 Minutes Cinebench, the Mosfets have an temperature of 58 Degrees Celsius and the PCH has an temperature of 50 Celsius while the Cooler Master Silencio 120mm fan I put on the Gamma from GameMax CPU cooler, turns 1000 rpm and all 4 Arctic F12 120mm case fans show an rpm of 700.\nI am surprised how this GameMax Gamma air cooler is able to maintain cool this CPU. So the huge aluminum coolers on the Mosfets of the MSi board sure do their job.\nThe board has lots of fan headers. Thats very good.\nI recommend this board for the AM4 system but be aware of the cheating PCIE slot advertisement, the sound problems and the rather difficult to use UEFI settings. But this is an robust board."

I tried it in several amd boards ranging from b450's through x570's. Non of the had this ram on their QVL, but XMP/EXPO/DOCP all worked correctly on every board I tried it on. MSI, Asus, and several Gigabyte boards.\n\nI ended up sticking it in my workshop computer. Simple Asus x570 tuf gaming plus wi-fi, running a Ryzen 7 5700g. Since the rig uses the on board IGP of the 5700g, it uses the system ram for video memory. The fastest you can put in helps, and this 4000 speed ram gets the job done at a great price."

The RGB lighting is gorgeous and syncs well with my motherboard. The performance is also top-notch, with fast speeds and low latency. The installation was easy, and the packaging was nice.\n\nThe only minor issue I have is that the RAM sticks are quite tall and they barely fit under my CPU cooler. I had to adjust the fan position a bit to make some room. It's not a big deal, but it would have been nice if they were a bit shorter or had a low-profile option.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this RAM to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish upgrade. I give it 4/5 stars."

Me gusta ensamblar yo mismo mis equipos y busqué una motherboard que tuviera el soporte para la 13va generación de Intel encontrando esta que menciono. Realicé el ensamble en el case Cougar Conquer 2, el ensamble de procesador, cableados, conexiones y enfriadores súper fácil siguiendo los manuales. El dolor de cabeza vino cuando una vez instaladas las memorias CORSAIR el equipo no era capaz de bootear y prendía la luz naranja indicando problema en el VRAM es decir en las memorias CORSAIR DDR5, pensé que quizá las memorias venían dañadas o quizá yo hice alguna conexión errónea por lo que decidí repetir mi ensamble completo =D. Una vez completado el error permanecía y ninguno de los manuales ayudaba con algún posible FIX para corregir el error. Después de ponerlas y retirarlas N veces empecé a preparar una devolución de las memorias porque todo indicaba estaban dañadas. Vi algunos videos en internet y encontré una guía para un problema similar que recomendaban aplicar un UPDATE del BIOS. Por mi falta de experiencia desmonté nuevamente todo mi ensamble y realicé el UPDATE del BIOS a través de la conexión trasera FLASHBACK que provee esta motherboard realizándolo sin ningún componente instalado, después supe que no era necesario haber desensamblado todo mi ensamble por 3a vez y pude haberlo realizado con todo instalado =D El update del BIOS tomó alrededor de 20 minutos y una vez concluido realicé el ensamble nuevamente y WOOW el booteo se hizó de manera correcta levantando mi ensamble. Ejecuté la función de Overclocking de Intelligence Overclock de ASUS y las memorias fueron ajustadas a correr a 5600Mhz (su velocidad nativa es de 5200Mhz), después de más de 1 mes de uso no he tenido ningún problema y estoy más que FELIZ con mi adquisición, súper recomendables estas memorias para tu ensamble. Yo adquirí 2 memorias de 32GB cada una y si en un momento por alguna necesidad decido llevarlo a 128GB no dudaré en adquirir este modelo de Memorias. Espero mi experiencia ayude a alguien más en su ensamble / Upgrade usando estas memorias de CORSAIR."

It looks great on my mostly white build PC and I have it running at 5400 via a user configurable XMP profile in my Gigabyte z690 aero D-BIOS.\n\nIt was not obvious at first why it was running at 4800 and that I only seemed to have one XMP profile to set. but as I discovered you can have up to 3 xmp profiles once set under advanced memory settings and SPD (Gigabyte z690 aero D)\n\nI'm sure this memory can be run at a higher frequency but that will involve changing voltages and timings which can be troublesome if not done correctly, and the BIOS will have to be reset.\n\nYou can check easily if you have the correct speed by going to Windows Task manager/Performance and Memory tab, or,download cpu-z app.\n\nI will purchase another 64bg of this memory to give me a total of 128gb for my system, which will be useful for vst libraries and video editing etc. But this will more than likely require adjusting voltages, etc, to get the required speed.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nUPDATE. I bought another pair of these sticks (black) for a total of 128gb\n\nI got the 64gb Corsair DDR5-5200mhz kits in the black version for an excellent price; this was to add to my Corsair 64GB DDR5-5200mhz white kit for a total of 128gb for my system. I would have preferred the white version I previously bought for my PC build, but the black sticks were much cheaper than what I originally paid; it was a no-brainer.\n\nI have these sticks and the white ones in an MSI z790 edge wi-fi motherboard. I had a Gigabyte z690 D aero, with 64gb white set in my original review , but I had to get another motherboard for various reasons.\n\nWith just two sticks in my motherboard I managed to get them running stable at 5400mhz. (XMP profiles), which was great, but when I added 4 sticks at 128gb, the fastest I could get was 4800mhz, that was both motherboards.\n\nHowever, Recently MSI updated their BIOS for this board which included fixes for better memory compatibility, so, I decided to try get 5200mhz running again, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, for a while. But, even after passing a memory test and playing a few games without any problems, I got a windows green screen error when I was closing down an app. So then, I decided to try and get at least 5000mhz running, which I have them running at now, stable. Actually, they are running at 5067mhz.\n\nI'm very happy with this speed and do not mind losing 200mhz from the speed they are supposed to run at. In fact, the speed difference when I had 64GB running at 5200 and beyond is actually quite negligible, according to various memory tests.\n\nOverall, I think this memory performs well and is from a top tier brand, which means better compatibility with motherboards. With future BIOS updates, perhaps 128gb might run at 5200 and beyond, stable, here's hoping.\n\nHighly recommended\n\nUPDATE 2.\n\nMSI released another BIOS update (7D91vH4) for my z790 wifi edge motherboard, which includes improved memory compatibility and many other updates. I updated it and adjusted the Dram frequency to 5200Mhz G2, while disabling the XMP profile, and it has been running stable while doing memory tests and playing games etc.\n\nMy current system specs:\nI9-13900k\nMSI z790 wi-fi edge\nGigabyte RTX 4070 aero\nAsus Essence STX II sound card\nKingston 1tb KC3000 PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD\nArctic liquid freezer II 360 RGB AiO\nAnother 3 nvme drives and two ssd’s"

Some didn't even have wheels to roll on any longer.  All of the children went online and chose chairs to fit their personalities, and this one was chosen by my teenage daughter.\n\nShe prefers the color black; therefore, the chair is perfect for her. She didn't want something too big, but she did need something to support her because she is a tall girl. This chair is quite comfy, simple to put together, and supports my daughter's posture and body.\n\nThis chair's mesh back support is appealing to me since it allows for constant airflow, which keeps my daughter from sweating and stinking up the room. She spends several hours a day in this chair, and the large cushions support her body without turning the seat cushion into a pancake.\n\nThe chair moves effortlessly, has adjustable armrests and a height adjustment, and comes with simple assembly instructions. We had the box unpacked and assembled, and the chair at her desk ready to use in fifteen minutes. It is also reasonably priced, which always makes a parent happy when they are overspending on children's stuff."

        "review": "So when I got the ram I ended up spending like 1 to about two hours trying to install it. I got a asrock b450 pro4 board. I got a ryzen 5600x cpu I recently had 16gb of this ram, then I decided to get the 32gb version of it. My motherboard max ram is 64Gb adding it up I was basically installing 48Gb all together. But for some reason when I add the two 16gb sticks with the two 8gb sticks, my computer for some reason would not boot up. Now this was me switching the rams around trying to figure out what was the problem. Because before I had some different brand name rams I mixed it with the Vulcan’s and it worked at 24gb but iv learned mixing different ram brands can cause issues and lower performance. But my pc still booted up, and ran pretty decent. But for some reason adding the same Vulcan Z”s 32gb with the 8gb ram did not boot up. At this point I was confused. Because it is so post to boot up, I ended up checking my motherboard website\nI was missing bios update 8.01 v2 1.2.0.8 apparently this update is for amd/ intel motherboards as well. It is so post to help with memory of your motherboard. So if you don’t have it please download it! A lot people that have gaming computers pre built just to game don’t know about bios updates. After removing one of the 16gb sticks and leaving the two 8gb sticks my pc finally booted up. I am still confused to the point where I don’t understand why it dose not boot up with both 16gb sticks and only one. I’m still getting my 32gb performance on my pc so I am happy with it. Now I just have one brand new 16gb ram stick collecting dust until i can figure out how to install it and get my 48Gb performance. Honestly I don’t know if it’s the company because i have seen a few reviews that these type of sticks are corrupted. So if you decide on buying Vulcan brand ram sticks good luck it might work and it might not work so your playing a dirty ball game :) hopefully if you missed this review before u bought the ram, and u have the same problem and u manage to find this an u try my methods explain above. An it helps YOUR WELCOME :)"

        "review": "This seems to be very good and affordable RAM. Looks like high quality Made in Taiwan. Worked right out of the box.\nI recommend.\nI ordered the MSi B450-A Max Pro motherboard when AM5 came out and paid around 80$ for it. A bit expensive but it is an ATX board. This RAM works with this motherboard right out of the box and is paired with an Ryzen 5900X. Super easy to install and flash with the BIOS button the Bios for the Ryzen 5000 series CPU's. Worked right out of the box. The board is better than the B450 board I have from Asus. Easy to install in my XPG Invader case.\nAt the beginning when freshly installed Windows 11 I got lots of sound problems. After installing the crap of MSi drivers and Utilities which actual version MSi's MSi Center was offering, my sound got messed up completely. Sound stutters becauso of the new sound drivers, Chipset drivers and the like. Headphones and 5.1 Speakers intermittently connected/disconnected causing delays and stutters. Looked like an software issue of MSi software. That foreced me to reinstall and erase from scrap Windows 10 and it offered then to upgrade to Windows 11. After that the problem was gone with only Windows drivers. Do not download the crap MSi Center offers. It can break your OS.\nOther than that this board suggests it has 2 full fledged PCIE x 16 slots of the 3.0 type. At least that is what customers will think easily. Think twice. It has only one x16 PCIE 3.0 slot and the long one below has x16 openings but only half of those have connector pins installed and the manual says it is not even an x8 slot but rather an x4 only. And to add insult to injury that slot is only 2.0. Completely misleading for an new buyer.\nOn the lower slot I have the GT 1030 GDDR5 from MSi installed I had still from Q1 2020. It works on low settings on some games like HnG from 2016 and gets between 52 fps and 60 fps.\nOther than that this MSi board works way better than the Asus B450 board I have on my other system from last year. The RAM slots are way easier to use and the sticks slide into them like lubricated. The dual channel works on this board which is on my Asus most likely defective (Asus refuses warranty). I use it with 32 GB (2 x 16) TeamGroup TCreate RAM sticks. High quality 3200 Mhz sticks for relatively cheap.\nIt is a good strong board with 2 massive coolers on the Mosfets. These massive coolers impressed me as an new inexperienced buyer for my very first build. So it slipped to me the issue with the PCIE \"x16\" slots.\nThis Motherboard worked straight out of the box. I use the Ryzen 5900X with this with an Gamemax Gamma 500 AM4 cooler. The coolers does not fit well the AM4 system since it's clip is way to stiff so I had to take the cooler off the CPU and bend a bit the clips till it fits just with a little pressure. Install the air coolers without too much pressure so it is not loose but can slide a bit is fine before snapping it gently in place. As original fit I got 66 Celsius to 70 Celsius on idle or doing basic work with that processor, but after bending the clips to aliviate the pressure I get now at the moment 51 Degrees Celsius. So if too much pressure is applied by the cooler onto the processor that rises the heat to a difference of about 20 Degrees Celsius. Any of these standard air coolers with heat pipes will be able to cool the Ryzen 5900X easily. While gaming it gets to about 61 degrees Celsius. My case has 3 fans in the front and 1 in the back.\nMSi's UEFI is a bit confusing if one is used to the Asus UEFI. But it has basically the same features but it is way more confusing. The fans can be adjusted better on MSi's BIOS. But with this 5900X duo deca core CPU, the PSU is annoyingly loud all the time. While on Ecomode with 65 Watts the whole system draws on gaming about 150 Watts. The board seems to have no problems to deliver power to the 5900X.\nRunning Cinebench with this board and 5900X CPU with settings to Ecomode 65Watt, the case fans kick in, the CPU has an temp of 61 Degrees Celsius after 5 Minutes Cinebench, the Mosfets have an temperature of 58 Degrees Celsius and the PCH has an temperature of 50 Celsius while the Cooler Master Silencio 120mm fan I put on the Gamma from GameMax CPU cooler, turns 1000 rpm and all 4 Arctic F12 120mm case fans show an rpm of 700.\nI am surprised how this GameMax Gamma air cooler is able to maintain cool this CPU. So the huge aluminum coolers on the Mosfets of the MSi board sure do their job.\nThe board has lots of fan headers. Thats very good.\nI recommend this board for the AM4 system but be aware of the cheating PCIE slot advertisement, the sound problems and the rather difficult to use UEFI settings. But this is an robust board."

I had to adjust the fan position a bit to make some room. It's not a big deal, but it would have been nice if they were a bit shorter or had a low-profile option.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this RAM to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish upgrade. I give it 4/5 stars."

Has plug and play functionality with the adverised 3200mhz spees running right after install no need to change things in the BIOS. And it comes with a lifetime warranty.\n\nCons: Unattractive basic design, It's expensive in my opinion. I got this for around $145 but the current price is now over $200 CAD! In just a month the price increased rapidly which I definitely don't like and would recommend others try to snag this on sale, or consider buying from Amazon US which has this priced much lower (even with conversion) than it is in Canada right now as of posting this review in August 2022.\n\nOverall I would recommend this Crucial DDR4 RAM to others 👍🏾"

The new system I purchased only came with one stick of 8 GB, so I needed a second stick so that I could have my RAM run in proper dual channel mode. After working 40 years as a computer hardware tech, I was very familiar with Crucial brand memory and figured I would not go wrong with them, and I was right. I popped it right in to an empty slot and my new system booted up into Windows 11 without a hitch and has been running beautifully. You can't go wrong with Crucial memory. So I have a new PC, a new operating system and new Crucial memory, I have to say I am a happy guy right now!\n\nI will be keeping an eye on memory prices and once they go back down again, I will be picking up either a 16 GB or 32 GB kit to fill my remaining two memory slots."

        "review": "It used to be that you would just \"buy RAM\", and hope for a good price because a warehouse hadn't burned down recently. Once performance increased, however, so did the complexity of matching RAM to your system.\n\nNevertheless, reputable manufacturers provide compatibility tables, and enough specs to be reasonably sure you are going to have success, and these modules are no exception.\n\nThey aren't glamorous, but honestly, only fools of the highest calibre would buy RAM for any purpose other than to reliably store a large collection of 1s and 0s until the power is turned off.\n\nI matched them to my el cheapo ASUS Prime B360M-A, and set them to run at the standard rated clock, and I've had zero memory-related problems since ( and it's been plenty long enough for such problems to show ). Overclocking is for dweebs.\n\nReally, these are quite uninteresting parts, as they should be. Firefox has never been happier to squander as much as it likes on my 400+ open tabs. Arguably, I could close some tabs, and then I wouldn't need the RAM, but let's be real: at such an affordable price point, it's better to have it and not need it, than need it, and not have it. Besides, I run virtualized machines, and they love the extra breathing room."

For basic office work solid option. Color correction not 100% so not the greatest for graphic artwork.\n\nCons:\nThe base and stand is a little tricky to connect to the actual monitor. I would recommend connecting the stand first before adding the base. There is a metal plate on the back of the monitor and you have to be very careful sliding it in, make sure it's at the bottom and you push forward all the way. Much easier when the monitor is laying flat on a surface."

I've seen a couple reviews that I think could have been solved by double checking this.\n\nBut on to the monitor itself. It's great! Bought it at ~$170 USD. Played games at double the quoted refresh rate and also at 30 fps. I haven't seen any ghosting, though this can happen apparently I may have just been very lucky so far. Refresh rates are great, playing Valorant, CSGO, and Apex hasn't been an issue. Losing gun fights in any of those games have been my own fault and not having hardware lag behind and my reactions not being able to quickly adjust.\n\nIf you aren't playing competitive games and are more looking for a media consumption tool or prioritize picture quality and color accuracy this probably won't be the panel for you. There are better options out there for that specific purpose but if you like to game and consume content this is a great bang for the buck monitor.\n\n1 small gripe I would have, but I understand for the price point it can't really be helped is that the monitor stand that comes with it isn't height adjustable.\nNot a big deal if you are planning on Vesa mounting it but something worth noting.\n\nAlso if you are planning on using this monitor and having sound out there are no on board speakers. Not an issue if you are planning on using headphones or have desk speakers but I have seen other reviews saying they were disappointed at the lack of them. So i figure I'd point that out if you were expecting them.\n\nOverall for I'd recommend this monitor to anyone who needs a great budget gaming monitor. Like I said just make sure to double check your settings, on the monitor and on your PC, when you first plug it in."

I wanted a triple monitor setup with the Dell centered, but I have a small desk, so larger monitors were going to overhang the desk sides and cause problems. These Koorui monitors are possibly the narrowest 21.5\" monitor you can buy.\n\nI can report that these are more than adequate, and raise that to fantastic given the price! Comparing them to a Dell Ultrasharp is hardly fair, but they're so close for day-to-day office productivity that I really don't notice. Another bonus is the PPI of 21.5\" FHD to 27\" WQHD is nearly identical. If you understood that, then you know why I think it's great. 😉\n\nSo, the nitpicks:\n\n- kinda crappy blackpoint; would not recommend for movies or production graphics work\n- the VESA mount area is flat at the bottom holes, and curved at the top ones; this means you will have to shim with spacers (I used three nylon washers at each of the top holes) if your VESA mount needs zero pressure to rotate correctly\n- while these have speakers, they're an afterthought: you get what you pay for here\n\nOverall, a superb value for adding some real estate, and a totally acceptable main monitor if you are on a tight budget."

        "review": "I recently acquired a monitor with high hopes of enhancing my computing and entertainment experiences. Unfortunately, my experience with this monitor has been quite disappointing, leading me to conclude that there are far superior options available on the market. From the moment I started using it, the glaring issues with the screen quality were impossible to ignore.\n\nOne of the most glaring problems with this monitor is the lackluster display quality. The screen looked dull and lacked vibrancy, failing to accurately reproduce colors and leaving images and videos looking washed out. The contrast ratio was abysmal, making it difficult to distinguish details in darker scenes or images. Even basic tasks like web browsing and word processing felt underwhelming due to the lack of visual clarity and crispness.\n\nMoreover, the viewing angles were extremely limited, causing distortion and color shifts when looking at the monitor from even a slightly off-center position. This severely hindered any attempts to collaborate or share content with others, as the poor viewing angles made it practically impossible for everyone to have a comfortable and clear view of the screen.\n\nThe monitor's refresh rate and response time were equally disappointing, leading to noticeable motion blur and ghosting during fast-paced activities like gaming or watching action-packed movies. This lack of responsiveness detracted significantly from the overall experience and made these activities far less enjoyable than they should have been.\n\nThe build quality of the monitor left much to be desired as well. The construction felt flimsy, and the stand provided limited adjustability, which made it challenging to find an ergonomic viewing angle. The overall design lacked the sleekness and elegance that one would expect from a modern monitor, further contributing to the sense of disappointment.\n\nWhile the price of the monitor may have initially seemed appealing, the compromised screen quality and overall performance were not worth the savings. It became evident that investing in a higher-quality monitor would have yielded a significantly better user experience and more enjoyable computing and entertainment activities.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly advise against purchasing this monitor based on my subpar experience. The poor screen quality, limited viewing angles, lackluster performance in terms of refresh rate and response time, and overall unsatisfactory build quality make this monitor a regrettable choice. There are undoubtedly better monitors available on the market that offer superior visual clarity, responsiveness, and overall user satisfaction. I hope that my review serves as a cautionary tale for those seeking a monitor that can truly elevate their computing and entertainment experiences."

        "review": "Really, it’s a 4/5 but I have to keep reminding myself that the monitor costs $115.\n\nCustomer service is super proactive and they stand behind their product. I had issues with the power cord and they resolved it very quickly.\n\nI bought it as a second monitor and the picture quality is SHOCKINGLY good. My main monitor is a 144Hz AOC gaming monitor and the picture quality is almost indistinguishable between the two. I didn’t try gaming on it and to be honest, I have no reason to. For browsing and office work, there is absolutely no complaints.\n\nThe build quality is questionable. I almost thought the box was empty when I got it because of how light it was. The cheap stand has no rigidity and whenever I bumped my desk, it would shake. A LOT. I fixed this by mounting my monitors on a desk mount and have not had this issue since.\n\nIf it’s your only monitor, or you have a sturdy desk, then it’s probably not a big deal. If you have dual monitors, consider an arm (which I highly recommend.) It’s just something to keep in mind.\n\nAll in all, 10/10 value. I’ve been meaning to upgrade my second monitor for a long time but spending $150+ on a monitor that gets limited use just feels wrong. $115 however? No regrets."

The plastic casing feels a bit flimsy and the monitor wobbles slightly when adjusting the tilt. Despite this, I am still satisfied with my purchase and believe that this monitor provides great value for its price point. Overall, if you are in the market for a budget-friendly monitor with good display and connectivity options, I would recommend considering this product."

Someone commented that the build quality was not so great, but weight is not build quality. The build quality is fine and I don't usually care about narrow bezels, but this are narrow and that means it's not so large. The controls are awkwardly laid out, but they are on all monitors, and you aren't going to use them often. There are not enough types of inputs, but who cares. HDMI and VGA. At $89 it would be the best monitor on the market if it was not some dim."

When it comes to the touchscreen capability they do not clearly indicate that you have to make the panel your primary monitor to make it work. So if you want to make this a secondary extended monitor in a PC setup it will not work properly for you. Secondly, my unit arrived defective, the touchscreen setup was off, I tried the rotation, tried a Windows 10 machine, many different things. I click on the screen and it reverses the touch in an odd way, even using the screen rotation button it just make it vertically off. User manual is hard to find and barely contains any information (n9.cl/g9kl07). The only note referring to the touchscreen is \"1) When the computer is connected to several different displays at the same time, only this LCD can be used to control the cursor on the main display, so we recommended setting this LCD as the main display.\". The panel itself is super clear and nice which is unfortunate because I wanted a touch interface. DO NOT try to use this as a secondary monitor with touchscreen, look elsewhere or buy without touchscreen for a regular mini-monitor."

        "review": "The color temperature was a little cool out of the box, easily corrected thanks to the firmware onboard. Cover glass is very good, looks sharp, easily viewable way off to the side. I'm building an HMI for a machine controller, but I'm handling all of the UI and display myself. I just needed the display, memory, power supply, and management IC and this delivers. Plug and play, works perfectly in Linux, has onboard image scaling in case you're using it with a system that insists on 1920x1080 resolution (some gaming applications).\n\nThe cables included are just long enough to set the host device beside or behind the display but they're quality. For a more permanent solution you'll need to select cables suitable for your specific use case since system integration is beyond the scope of the display module. This keeps costs low, provides a workable solution, and prevents us from buying cables we may not even need, so I appreciate the decision.\n\nThe screws at the corners hold the display module, front, and back of the case together and provide an easy point for you to attach custom mounting options to the rear. If you'd rather add bolts, use adhesive, or something else like nanotape, the rear of the case is nice and flat. The two-position kickstand works very well and doesn't collapse accidentally in my experience, it has a nice cam detent molded into the stand. Don't forget to 'calibrate your display' in whatever OS you're using to get your touch digitizer coordinates where you want them but mine was pretty close to begin with."

The colors are bright and vivid, the blacks are solid, the picture overall is smooth and crisp, and the touch interface is responsive and accurate -- this is basically as good as the display on your high-end smartphone.\n\nThe 1-star reviewer is partially right: the native orientation of this display is vertical (portrait), so when the Raspberry Pi in my Voron boots up, the console is sideways at first. There's probably a way to change the orientation with the boot flags, but it's not a problem for me, as the X server definitely outputs at whatever orientation you tell it to.\n\nOverall, this is a very fine display -- a little on the expensive side, but worth it if you really need a quality image for your project."

        "review": "I have been using two monitors for ages, over the last five years I have been using 34\" ultra wide monitors paired with a 27\" 16x9 monitor, but I decided to try something new and purchased a Samsung CRG9 for gaming. After a couple of days, I was really missing my second display. I usually used it for keeping an eye on my temperatures and clocks while I'm gaming.\nNeedless to say, I thought a portable laptop screen might do the trick. Since it was just for displaying monitoring software I did not need anything high quality or fancy, so I ordered this 15\" Koorui.\nFirst oops was that I didn't realize my GPU did not have a USBc, but no problem since they also supplied an HDMI cable...oops again, there is no power adapter for the USBc cable...lucky I have a USBc on my motherboard, but they really need to include a power adapter with the monitor.\nInitial inspection was much better than I thought it would be. The monitor feels a little premium, possibly due to the folio cover.\nPowering on the device brought up the picture, and I was a little underwhelmed. The picture is slightly dull...just slightly. I tried adjusting the brightness and contrast, but it's as good as it gets. It's not bad really since I'm comparing it to the $1100 monitor above it, but it does do the job of displaying my monitoring software splendidly.\n\nA couple of beefs. First, it would have been nice if the cables were longer. I had to use my own USBc cable because the one they provide is only about three feet long.\nThe second is that they, like the rest of the manufacturers, put the ports on the side of the display like a tablet.\nCome on guys, this is a monitor, not a tablet. As you can see in the picture, the ports sticking out the side are an ugly quality of life issue could easily have been avoided. Recessing them in the back would have been perfect, but having them sticking out the back would hvae been fine as well. Anything but sticking out the side like this.\n\nOther than that, it's the little monitor that could. It's working perfectly for the purpose I bought it for. Having it set up this way though, if I had to make the choice again, for this particular usage I would have picked a 14\" model. The 15\" is a touch too big for this purpose.\n\nIn any case, if this monitor turns out to be reliable then it's easily worth the price I paid ($117 + Tax). I would recommend it for this purpose."

        "review": "For budget gamers like me who are also casual gamers, I got some tips to improve your experience with this monitor. Obviously for the price you will get what you pay for. However, you can still very much enjoy medium pace competitive gaming with the adequate tweaks in-game as well as in the monitor settings. I have enjoyed 60hz monitor experience for most of my time gaming and you should expect smoother gameplay as well as slightly more in-depth/ less pixelated video quality. That being said, there are limits to what games you can play. Using this monitor works well for me for Rainbow 6 Siege and Read Dead Redemption 2. I doubt playing fast pace triple-A games like Warzone will work with this monitor. Important to mention, after spending a few hours on this monitor I have gotten used to the ghosting where it seems not apparent to me anymore or it's so minimal. Just a warning though, do expect poor video quality to compensate for better motion. But overall in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the cons in my book. You sacrifice some video quality for more smooth motion as well as high refresh rate.\n\nSteps to fix ghosting issues:\n- Set contrast and brightness on monitor to 100/ max\n- Turn on overdrive (OD) to extreme\n- Turn on freesync premium and enable g sync in nvidia control panel\n- Use Gamma 1 because you need that high contrast\n- Ensure you use the 165hz in your windows setting as well as in-game setting\n- In-game limit your fps to 165hz or unlimited\n- In the nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings: turn low latency mode to ultra and power management mode to prefer maximum performance.\n\nNow this part is subjective to users:\n- In-game test out contrast and sharpness to near maximum effectiveness. You can over-saturate these effects which can become negatively impactful.\n- In-game adjust brightness accordingly where you can see shades from black to white appropriately.\n\nIn conclusion, this monitor has been a good upgrade from my 60 hz monitor as it is smoother in gameplay and less pixelated when viewing from further distances. A good step forward from entry level gaming on a budget. Although setting up tweaks for games for the first time and later on will be an inconvenience but well worth it if you don't mind."

The only thing you will need is how to plug the usb to a power outlet. I didn’t need one because I already have one on my desk. I don’t do any design or any activities that require colour calibration, so the brightness and colours seem perfect to me. Connecting it was super easy and straight forward, no need to configure anything. The speakers are also pretty decent, and the monitor has a volume button on the right side next to the power button. If you push up, it will show the volume menu and if you push down it will first show the mode menu. From there you can choose: Standard, cinema, RTS, FPS or eye saver."

        "review": "Out of the box the fit and finish and magnetic flap/stand all feel very high quality.\n\nWithout reading the manual (which wouldn't have helped anyway), I figured out how to plug it in and get it up and running in Windows 11. Pretty intuitive and well integrated process.\n\nMy 13 inch HP spectre has 2 USB-c ports. This monitor also has 2 USB-c ports. A single cable between them will work with any pair of ports. however in that case the brightness is limited at 50% due to power limitation. By connecting the laptop charger to the Koorui monitor, and with a single USB-c cable leading back to the laptop, there's no longer any power limitation and I can get 100% brightness and 100% volume. The pleasant surprise for me was the single display cable, also *back charges* the laptop, although at a low wattage. I can leave the laptop in high performance mode, and the battery drains only very very slowly and can last at least 2 days.\n\nI bought two of these Koorui's, the second one used HDMI to mini HDMI with Windows 10, on an eight year old laptop. That also worked flawlessly. However, a second USB-c power source was needed to turn on the monitor at all (which it would do at full power), because HDMI doesn't deliver power.\n\nThese Koorui monitor feel more comfortable to read than either of my laptops (one of which is a high end 4k screen). It has a matte finish and nice looking black to white transitions, making photos look very natural. I really like the colors and reading experience.\n\nThe only downside I found was the manual. It repeats hazard warning in six languages, but doesn't tell you you need to hold down the power button for a few seconds to turn it on, because the power button doubles as menu and select button. The entire monitor settings UI is handled with only 3 buttons. It work well once you figure it out, but the \"manual\" doesn't have a single mention of any of this. Nor does it discuss compatibility and power requirements. Why try so hard at making a great product, but remain at such an amateur level writing the manual? That's the thing that bugged me.\n\nFor gaming you only get 60hz refresh, so I haven't tried it for gaming and don't plan to use it that way. For remote learning and remote meetings, a highly portable second screen is a really nice thing to have. Overall for the extremely friendly price, I really appreciate being able to purchase this product."

It was a bit confusing to set up as you need to connect two cords but it works great!\n\nI wanted to use it at home as a third monitor and bought an adaptor to do so. Unfortunately, it flickers on and off. It’s possible my computer (Dell i5 Inspiron) doesn’t have enough processing power to support 3 screens in total. When I choose my next computer I will make sure it works. It’s a great little screen and the resolution is fantastic!"

Overall I am satisfied, and this works for what I use it for (use it as secondary monitor during presentations). I do not particularly care about color accuracy, and I do not use this outside to care about brightness.\nWith that being said, out of the box the colours were noticeably inaccurate and greenish. I had to dig into the menus to create a custom color by adjusting RGB values. It never got very good, so if you think you want to watch videos, look at pictures, or play games on this, this is probably not for you. It does save the color settings even when powered off, so that's good.\nThe only minor annoyance is that it does not save the brightness settings and resets it back to 4 after every power off. The screen needs that to be on \"10\" for it to be usable. When I'm not using this for presenting (as a second cloned monitor), I use it to view and compose a lot of text, such as documents and emails. It is ok for that, but I really wish it could go a little brighter.\nIf this was not at the price point that I got it at I would have returned it and looked for another portable monitor, just because of colors and brightness. Otherwise the monitor works great over USB-C (only thing I have used so far)."

(The driver board was already connected on the one I received, just had to connect to the Pi.).\nTouch is responsive, works well.\n\nNegative points:\nThe position of the SD card slot on the Pi makes it fiddly to access when the screen is connected with the ribbon cable. Especially if you have it any kind of enclosure. So you can't change operating envoirnment easily.\nThis is a bare screen and driver board (no bezel or enclosure).\n\nRaspian issues:\nThe screen will first boot upside-down in many available cases. this is easy fixed (Google it) but is annoying :) .\nThe virtual keyboards with the latest Raspian OS on Pi 3B+ (my experience) are pretty useless, but this isn't an Android phone, so make sure you have a wireless keyboard with a touchpad."

Il existe plusieurs tutos dans Youtube toujours en anglais. La carte contrôleur de l'écran ne possède aucune LED donc impossible de savoir si la carte est correctement alimentée sous 5V. Bien nettoyer les contacts du câble plat car la présence de vernis m'avait laissé l écran totalement noir identique à l'écran hors tension... ou hors service.\nVérifier la bonne orientation du câble plat partie conductrice grise vers le haut sur le connecteur de la carte contrôleur et l'autre bout de ce câble la partie grise conductrice orientée vers le connecteur de la caméra sur le Raspberry. L'écran reste totalement noir au démarrage du boot le temps que le port video soit activé durant la progression du boot puis s'illumine. Le résultat est de bonne facture très compacte et si pratique quand on a plus besoin de clavier ni souris. Le montage devient \"presque\" une tablette tactile précise et efficace. L'économiseur d'écran éteint totalement l'écran comme s'il était hors tension. Attention de ne pas couper brutalement l'alimentation du Raspberry en pensant le shutdown activé!\nLe seul \"petit\" reproche est l'impossibilité de règler luminosité et contraste car l'écran est un peu trop lumineux le soir ou dans la pénombre. Mais on s'habitue très vite pour l'utilisation ioT des objets connectés. J'en commande un second dans la foulée. Bon assemblage pour ceux qui vont ouvrir les deux boites!\nPS. même le samsung avait souffert pour la photo devant la luminosité de l'écran!"

The purpose of the purchase is to use it as a sensor panel. The picture quality is fantastic, I'm quite impressed. I have the resolution set at 1920 x 1080. I did purchase an adapter so it is powered directly off the motherboards USB header pins. I will update once I have designed the display using Aida64. I will be mounting it in my Asus Prime case AP201. Also as others have stated before the included cables are very short. So you will need to purchase separate cables to your desired length. The touch screen does work however it's not needed for my use of the display panel. I would recommend this one if your looking to for some extra bling to your case!"

Even after the screen was turned off for a while, the ghost image was still there.\n\nThe settings on the raspberry was also updated as required to make it work with the screen resolution.\n\nAlso I have no idea if this was a defective item that was returned and then put back into stock and sold again... will return this one and purchase another one to see if I have better luck the 2nd time.\n\nUPDATE - 2nd one works, so updating my review to 4/5 (only because the first unit was defective)"

I tried to manually install a driver in windows 11 and just couldn't find one online. But after a normal restart the screen kicked right on and started to work fine. It list the driver as Generic PnP Monitor. I can choose the recomended 1024*600 or 800*600. Both do work and the touch screen started to work also. I can move my mouse curser with just touching the screen. Been using it for a few days now to display wallpaper engine while out of a game and then load Aida64 on it when in game. Again it won't turn the screen off unless you chose to power off your usb devices from within Bios. Or what i did was buy a usb hub with on/off switches and use the switch to shut that port off if i leave my system running over night. Here is the link to the hub i am using. https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00BWF5U0M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Hope this helps some of you"

If you're also planning on using the display inside a PC case, I highly recommend buying a new flat HDMI and USB micro cable, since the ones that come with the display way too short and chunky.

        "review": "Many people here are looking at these panels for DYI sensory panels for there PC. I spent a lot of time looking at many different panels to try to find better value or at least something that made the most sense for my project. Funny thing is I started off with this panel first and thought there has to be a better option. Long story short not really even when I considered spend more money.\n\nThese types of mods get expensive really fast. $80 for the panel, $60 for Aida64 (You can use the trail but eventually you will pay the money because you want everything unlocked), $30 for alternative skinner cords that are longer the moment you see the cords you will want to change them. I knew this from the start so in my mind this panel costs $120 because I got new cords to go with it longer for cable management. Then maybe $5 for the little standoff box to give mounting options but honestly tap could work just as well it's really light.\n\nNext you have things like buying a motherboard header to micro USB i wasted more money when I realized I did not have the slot available on my moba. This panel because it's higher resolution and quality does require a fair amount of power.\n\nAlso I went with the 7\" to be honest if you have the space go bigger there was no changes to my temperatures or any impact. I do enjoy looking at it\n\nI was thought many times if sending everything back but ultimately it was 100% worth it in the end.\n\nMinor Q&A if you use the mobo header it turns off with the PC. If you use USB you can still turn it off with the PC just change one settings in the bios and continue with life. It's the onboard USB power.\n\nASUS Z690-E --->Advanced -->onboard devices and configuration --->USB power delivery in soft state\n\nIt's pretty similar for most motherboards. Lastly have fun."

        "review": "As someone who spends long hours in front of a computer screen, I understand the importance of having a high-quality monitor that provides an immersive and comfortable viewing experience. Recently, I decided to upgrade my monitor to the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor, drawn to its IPS technology, sleek design, and promised eye care features. With hopes of enhancing my visual enjoyment and reducing eye fatigue, I eagerly incorporated this monitor into my workstation.\n\nWhy I Needed the Product:\nMy previous monitor was outdated, and I desired a larger screen with better contrast and brightness. Additionally, I wanted to protect my eyes from strain and fatigue caused by long hours of staring at a screen. The KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor seemed like a suitable solution, offering improved visuals, reduced eye fatigue, and versatile connectivity options.\n\nPros:\n\nImmersive Visuals and Wide Viewing Angle: The IPS technology and ultra-thin bezel design of the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor deliver brilliant and clear visuals. The wide viewing angle of 178 degrees ensures a pleasant visual experience from any angle, allowing me to appreciate the sharp and delicate images displayed on the screen.\nEye Care Features: The monitor incorporates flicker-free technology, a blue light filter, and 99% SRGB (NTSC 72%) color saturation. These features contribute to a more realistic picture, reduced eye fatigue, and increased visual comfort during long hours of use.\nVersatile Connectivity: With HDMI and VGA ports, the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor offers versatile connectivity options, allowing me to connect it to various devices such as Xbox, PC, and laptops. The 75Hz refresh rate and Full HD 1920x1080p resolution ensure high-quality images and smooth transitions, facilitating a seamless switch between work and entertainment.\nVESA Compatibility: The monitor stand is quickly installed and supports a 75x75mm VESA mount, providing convenience and flexibility in positioning and adjusting the monitor. The tilt feature allows me to find the best viewing angle, enhancing my overall comfort and experience.\nCons:\n\nInconsistent Contrast and Brightness: Unfortunately, I found the contrast and brightness of the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor to be lacking. The screen failed to deliver the desired levels of contrast, resulting in a somewhat dull visual experience.\nOccasional Glitches: One significant drawback I experienced was occasional screen glitches and momentary blackouts when connected to my Mac. While I suspect that the issue may be related to the dongle connecting the laptop and the screen, it remains a frustrating disruption to my workflow.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor offers a mixed bag of features and performance. While it delivers on its promise of immersive visuals, wide viewing angles, and eye care features, the inconsistent contrast and occasional glitches dampen the overall experience. Despite these drawbacks, the monitor's versatile connectivity options, VESA compatibility, and reasonable price point make it a viable option for those seeking a budget-friendly upgrade. However, it is important to be aware of the potential issues with contrast, brightness, and occasional glitches, which may impact the overall satisfaction and reliability of the monitor."

        "review": "Today I set up my dual KOORUI 27\" model N07 monitors. I was somewhat worried by multiple reviewers reporting that this model isn't really a 4K screen. So while I don't usually write reviews, I'm here to assure you the N07 is in fact a 4K screen with resolution of 3840x2160 and refresh rate of 60hz.\n\nAnd I know why some people got this wrong. When I unplugged my old 1920x1080 monitors and tried to use the same HDMI cables, Windows identified the monitor as having a 1920x1080 native resolution. But my cables were very old. I plugged both my new monitors in using DisplayPort cables and they were instantly reporting 3840x2160. My monitors did not come with DP cables, just new HDMI cables. But my office had extra DP cables laying around.\n\nIf you're still having trouble getting 4K on one of these, be wary of adapters, such as DP-to-HDMI, DVI-to-HDMI, etc. Also try shorter or newer cables. You CAN get 4K out of HDMI cables, but remember that HDMI has been around since 2002 and that standard has gone through many versions with new capabilities over the years.\n\nAs for reviewing the other aspect of these monitors... they look great to me! Neither of mine had dead or stuck pixels. the colors look good and image is sharp. I'm not a professional monitor reviewer, but these seem like perfectly good office monitors for a fantastic price compared to big brand names. I took a chance on some of their smaller screens several months back and was blown away at the quality and low price. I'm glad this higher end model hasn't let me down!"

Questo monitor offre un eccellente rapporto qualità-prezzo, soddisfacendo le mie aspettative senza svuotare il mio portafoglio.\n\nIniziamo parlando delle dimensioni: il pannello da 27\" offre un'ampia area di visualizzazione, che consente una maggiore immersione durante l'utilizzo. La risoluzione è nitida e la qualità dell'immagine è davvero buona. Anche i colori sono ben bilanciati e vividi, offrendo un'esperienza visiva piacevole durante la visione di contenuti multimediali o durante l'utilizzo quotidiano.\n\nLa frequenza di aggiornamento di 75 Hz è un vantaggio significativo per gli appassionati di gaming o per coloro che lavorano con applicazioni che richiedono un movimento fluido. Ho notato che i movimenti sullo schermo sono più fluidi e reattivi rispetto al mio precedente monitor. Anche se non è la frequenza di aggiornamento più elevata sul mercato, per il prezzo a cui ho acquistato questo monitor, è una caratteristica davvero apprezzabile.\n\nLa connettività è facile e veloce grazie alle opzioni di porte disponibili. Ho potuto collegare facilmente il mio computer tramite l'interfaccia HDMI e ho apprezzato la compatibilità con altri dispositivi grazie alle porte VGA e DVI. L'angolo di visione è ampio, permettendomi di guardare lo schermo senza perdere qualità visiva da diverse posizioni.\n\nUna delle cose che ho apprezzato di più è stata la facilità di configurazione. L'interfaccia del menu è intuitiva e mi ha permesso di regolare facilmente le impostazioni dello schermo secondo le mie preferenze personali. Inoltre, il monitor è dotato di un supporto regolabile in altezza che mi ha consentito di posizionarlo in modo comodo e ergonomically corretto.\n\nNon posso dimenticare di menzionare il design estetico del monitor. Con cornici sottili e un aspetto elegante, si adatta bene a qualsiasi ambiente di lavoro o a qualsiasi arredamento domestico. Non solo offre prestazioni solide, ma aggiunge anche un tocco di stile alla mia postazione.\n\nComplessivamente, sono davvero soddisfatto del mio acquisto del monitor esterno da 27\" a 75 Hz. Le sue prestazioni solide, il rapporto qualità-prezzo eccezionale e la facilità di utilizzo lo rendono una scelta eccellente per chiunque cerchi un monitor affidabile per le proprie esigenze quotidiane o per il gaming. Consiglio vivamente questo monitor a chiunque sia alla ricerca di un'opzione di qualità senza dover spendere una fortuna."

Compatibility- Once assembled, I connected the monitor to my Mac for the first time in less than a minute. There was seamless compatibility between the two devices. I encountered no glitching of any kind.\n2. Picture Quality- When doing work, I see no issues with the quality of the picture. I was able to read and type without complication. The monitor even includes different viewing modes for gaming, cinema, and eye-saver (to reduce optical stress from staring at a screen).\n3. Included Items- The package includes an HDMI cord, which I thought was very satisfactory considering the low cost. While I have to use an HDMI to USB-C cord because I have a Mac, it's beneficial to have an extra HDMI cord at hand.\n4. Value- I am very pleased with the incredible value. Koorui makes high-quality monitors for a low price by not including speakers. For working, I see no need for speakers. However, even if you do need speakers you can always connect a soundbar, stereo system, or even a portable speaker to your computer to get sound. Great price for a great monitor.\n5. Design- This monitor does not look like something you could purchase for this price. It has a sleek and simple design with very little border around the screen. Furthermore, the size is great for the price they are asking. I was amazed by how large it was!\n\nCons:\n1. Assembly- The instructions on the box and manual for assembling the stand were difficult to read and the portrayed pieces did not match those delivered to me. I was better off just assembling off of common sense.\n2. Picture Quality- I wouldn't recommend this monitor for cinematic purposes. The picture quality of videos is definitely pixelated. However, you get what you pay for.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, it is an efficient monitor for a good value. I experienced some issues, but it was worth it in the end."

        "review": "The ViewSonic VA2447-MHJ 24 Inch Full HD 1080p Monitor brings together innovative design and high-quality performance, delivering an immersive user experience tailored for both home and office environments.\n\nThe moment you set your eyes on this monitor, the ultra-thin bezel captures your attention, offering a nearly seamless viewing experience. This design feature allows for more screen space, which is particularly advantageous for multi-monitor setups. The matte finish on the screen was also a pleasant surprise, helping to reduce unwanted reflections and glare that could disrupt the viewing experience.\n\nA stand-out feature of the VA2447-MHJ is its advanced ergonomics. The monitor offers a broad range of adjustments for tilt, height, swivel, and rotation, allowing users to personalize their setup for maximum comfort. These ergonomics, combined with a reasonable 24-inch size, make this monitor a good fit for those who spend extended hours in front of a screen.\n\nThe 1080p Full HD resolution ensures crisp and clear visuals. While this is now somewhat a standard feature in monitors, the added AMD FreeSync technology takes the display quality to another level. For those unfamiliar, FreeSync synchronizes the monitor's refresh rate with your device's graphics card to prevent screen tearing, ensuring smooth visuals even during high-intensity gaming or video playback.\n\nThe VA2447-MHJ also sports a refresh rate of 75Hz, which is a small step up from the standard 60Hz most commonly found in monitors. While the difference may not be noticeable for general web browsing or office work, the added smoothness is a welcome addition for gamers or those who often watch high-speed videos.\n\nA commendable feature that ViewSonic incorporates into its product is the eye care technology. This feature includes a flicker-free backlight and a blue light filter, both aimed at reducing eye strain during extended use. As someone who spends several hours in front of a screen, this is an addition I truly appreciate.\n\nAs for connectivity, the monitor supports HDMI and VGA inputs, offering a fair bit of versatility. However, the absence of a DisplayPort or USB-C might be a limiting factor for some users, especially those with newer laptops or gaming consoles that have moved away from HDMI and VGA.\n\nIn conclusion, the ViewSonic VA2447-MHJ is a reliable, high-performing monitor, offering a solid balance between aesthetic design and functional features. While the connectivity options could be broader, the overall package is quite compelling, making it a robust choice for both home and office use. The advanced ergonomics and eye-care technology further demonstrate ViewSonic's commitment to delivering not only performance but also user comfort and wellbeing."

Excellent value for money as long as you know what the stats are going to be like in real life.\n\nThe picture isn't the best gaming/editing monitor out there, but for what they say they are, they match the description perfectly. I rated the picture at 4 for this reason.\n\nExcellent value for money, and very simple/light weight design.\n\nBonus for me was the quick-detach monitor stands. The stands themselves are simple but useful enough, and collapse back down the way they were shipped if you want to store them a little easier, they clip solidly to the back of the monitor and that doesn't interfere with any mounts you have also installed."

My old 28\" screen showed color distortions in the corners at that distance and this curved Samsung solved that problem.\n\nThe reason that I chose this monitor over others in the same price range was the native 3000-1 contrast ratio on the VA screen. A higher contrast ratio will give you deeper black levels, much more than the common 1000-1 ratio on IPS screens. It's not OLED levels of black but it's not an OLED priced screen. (I got mine for 50% of the current price). And forget about the \"Dynamic Contrast\" scam that promises 1,000,000-1 contrast ratios, you'll want to immediately disable that horrendous feature and then you'll be back to 1000-1.\n\nI found a site that has the optimum color/contrast/brightness/ect settings for this monitor and they made a huge difference. I'm amazed at how good the image is on this screen. For instance, grass looks green like grass should, not the sort of lime green that I see on so many screens. And my gold standard is the red color of the engineering class uniforms on the original Star Trek. They look fire engine red instead of the slightly magenta hued red that I see on so many uncorrected screens.\n\nI only use headphones fed from the blu ray player so the speakers aren't an issue for me and I find the controls quite easy to use.\n\nBeing a curved screen there is a sweet spot for viewing which I find to be around the one meter distance. There's no viewing from a side angle on this screen, it's kind of a one person device. But when you get this monitor set-up it does nothing annoying, it's a pure delight to have in front of your eyes."

It has a high-speed gaming mode for playing gaming and an eye-sync feature for protecting your eyes from long-time gaming. I very enjoy it. But there are some improvements are also need to be pointed out. firstly, the 32-inch monitor stand is tended to be \"too short\", and the monitor stand does not support adjusting the height. I am using this monitoring for both gaming and daily use. This monitor is used as an extended monitor for my laptop. It is hard to adjust the height of this monitor to fit my laptop. Second, it is hard to buy a monitor arm for it. The current market has classified monitor stands/arms/mounts into different categories, less than 12 inches, 13 inches - 27 inches, 27 inches -32 inches, and more than 33 inches. The 27 inches - 32 inches class monitor arm may not be the best choice for this monitor because of its weight but the 33 inches class monitor arms are usually costly. Third, this monitor does not contain the speaker, microphone, or camera features. For your best gaming experience, you need to spend more money on these features. overall, this monitor still be a good 2K monitor product and a good choice for a $200 level budget monitor."

I play basic things like chess, backgammon, and other games, so I can't comment on it's gaming features.\n\nI mention the input options because in reading some answers to a question I put forward on how to shut this monitor off, someone who obviously answers questions without understanding or reading them claimed falsely that her monitor shut off when she shut her computer off. That is not the case.\n\nUSB ports are the only things I know of which shut down automatically when you power off your computer or laptop. If a usb port is an option it's not an option on this monitor, and I wouldn't select that option anyway because it would needlessly use up a usb port.\n\nMy computer has 5 usb ports. One is used for my mouse, another for my wireless keyboard, The other 3 I use for everything else. Sometimes I move files from a usb to an external hard drive for storage purposes, so having 2 usb inputs on the front of my tower comes in handy. I wouldn't want to lose that ability by having to devote the 3rd rear input to my monitor. I have a 3 port splitter on that right now for a usb drive I keep plugged in for daily storage of things like emails etc...\n\nToo many devices these days charge or work off of usb ports, and nobody makes a laptop or tower computer with 152 usb inputs. So I chose to opt for the D-Sub cable option.\n\nI could also free up 2 more usb inputs on the back if I opted for 5 pin type inputs instead of usb inputs for my mouse and keyboard.\n\nThis monitor, like all others I've ever owned has a power cord. The power cord does not plug into the back of a tower computer or a laptop, hence turning off your computer or laptop won't shut it off.\n\nI own an old 1970's era Realistic model stereo amp which has power outlets on the back. One works independent of the amp, and the other is for my turntable. It works with the amp. When you power off the amp, the turntable powers off as well. I'm not aware of things like tower computers or laptops with this feature where you can actually plug in another device which will shut off when you shut off the main device.\n\nAs a rule, one should take note that if a device has it's own power supply, it does not just go into standby mode when you power off your computer. Nor does it shut off automatically when your computer powers off. It has to be shut off to actually be off. That power supply is where the power comes from. It's not coming from the computer, so shutting the computer off does not shut off power to the monitor.\n\nSome people who answered had some somewhat helpful advice. But many didn't seem to grasp a very simple question about how to shut this monitor off.\n\nWhen I checked some reviews I found some proper helpful advice.\n\nOne review noted the backwards nature and stupidity of putting the power button on the back of the monitor where it is hard to reach and work and the fact that this monitor is backwards to most in that a blue light comes on when it is shut off, and there is no light on when it's in use.\n\nMy previous monitor would - like most - have no light on when turned off. When you would power down a yellow light would come on, and you would click on that to shut it off. When you would power up (assuming you power up your computer before powering up your monitor) a blue light would come on and stay on during use. Otherwise if you opted to turn the monitor on first, the yellow light would come on until you powered up the computer, then the light would turn blue and stay on during use.\n\nThis monitor, as someone else rightly pointed out - is all over the map in that regard.\n\nTo shut it off you power down your computer, then you have to reach under to the back of the monitor and push the only button it has on it (stupid design flaw most would agree). When you do that it puts up an on-screen menu. Rather than having a sensible option like pushing it once more to shut it off - instead a refresh icon appears in the middle of the button, so you have to \"toggle\" down to the bottom of the button and select the power icon. Once you've done that, then you have to push that button.\n\nBy toggling down what you have to do is press the very bottom of the button on the back. At first I couldn't figure out how to do that, but if you press the bottom like you would with a joystick it will select the power button option.\n\nOnly then - once you've pushed the button for the third time in all, will the monitor power off\n\nAgain, when you shut your computer off, the blue light will blink every few seconds. That means it's still on. It's not in standby or off. It is still sucking power when the blue light is blinking. Only when you go through the 3 steps in shutting it off - as described above, will that blue light become constantly on, and thus the monitor is truly shut off.\n\nAs other reviews have pointed out that is very backwards to how most monitors work. When your computer is on and you have the monitor on - the blue light is completely off. Yet when the blue light is constantly on, and not blinking - that's when it's off.\n\nWhen you start your computer you have to push to button on the back to turn the monitor on.\n\nI hope this helps anyone buying one of these monitors. Overall I'm happy with this monitor. It's a wider screen than my previous one. An Acer which worked fine for about 23 years in all. But overall better and much lighter in terms of product weight."

Middle button brings up on screen and go from there. It's like the tv remote: you have to toggle l/r/up/down, and it's small. A better design would give it a 5 star rating.

I'm not a gamer so I don't need 120Hz refresh rates. All I needed was something that would be easy on my eyes, look good in my space, and have a nice crisp display.\n\nThis monitor is simple to set up. It's got 3 screws. You can move it side to side but there's only 20 degrees of vertical movement. That's fine if you want to look at your monitor head-on or angled slightly up at you but if you need something that tilts downward you'll have to get a VESA mount that either clamps to your desk or mounts to your wall.\n\n22 inches is plenty big with an HD screen and just what I needed when in a dual or triple monitor situation (occasionally I use my work-provided monitor in a 3 monitor setup).\n\nFor music production it doesn't strain your eyes to be staring at it for hours on end. Same when you're programming. Any monitor will give you eye strain eventually but this one is not going to give most people any issues most of the time.\n\nYou have options for HDMI or VGA connections. In my case I had to use a VGA cable for my work monitor in the past so I got an adapter for my laptop for USB-C to VGA connections. This works fine and the quality is the same as HDMI with this particular monitor because VGA quality goes up to around a thousand more pixels than 1080p and supports a refresh rate of 85Hz (assuming you didn't get a cheap cable). This monitor has a 75Hz refresh rate so using a VGA connection is not going to reduce quality. In fact I suspect that they chose HDMI and VGA precisely because the monitor works within the VGA spec and HDMI is just a very common connector these days so they included both while excluding DisplayPort because that's mainly used for higher spec machines and people shopping for a budget monitor likely wouldn't have a DisplayPort compatible computer. Plus DP is not super common anyway outside of offices and expensive computers and has little practical benefits over HDMI to the average person right now.\n\nBut don't let the fact that this is a budget monitor fool you. If you know you need higher refresh rates because you'll be watching movies and gaming then sure, this isn't for you. If you know you're going to be doing work, browsing the web, watching YouTube videos, coding, doing regular boring average computer stuff, then this is going to be more than enough for you. This is the monitor that should be the default standard for everyone looking for an external laptop monitor or that would come with any PC bundle. I wouldn't want lower quality and most wouldn't even notice higher specs if it had them. It's in the perfect spot.\n\nIf you need an excellent monitor that isn't a thousand dollar gaming monitor that's basically a flat screen TV made for the Super Bowl then this will be as good as any other."

        "review": "The TP-Link 10Gb TX401 Ethernet card has a hardware design that supports Wake-on-LAN (WoL). Most other 10Gb Ethernet cards from other brands do not support WoL. When the PC is put to sleep mode, the TP-Link TX401 remains switched on and connected to the network while waiting for a Magic Packet to resume the PC if this option is enabled in Windows.\n\nThe TP-Link TX401 has a Marvell (formerly Aquantia) AQtion AQC107 chipset running at PCIe 3.0 speed. All three cards I received came with firmware version 3.1.100.\n\nInstead of using the drivers provided on the CD-ROM, I downloaded the latest official drivers and firmware from Marvell Public Driver Downloads website. In Category, select Marvell Public Drivers and in Part Number, select AQC107 and click Apply to view available downloads.\n\nI updated the cards to firmware 3.1.121, and I'm using Marvell Windows drivers version 3.1.7.\n\nFor my LAN setup, the TP-Link TX401 cards are connected to a TRENDnet TEG-S750 5-Port 10GbE switch. The switch is also connected to the 10G Ethernet port of the Bell Giga Hub. Surprisingly, I get a stable 10 Gbps connection speed over CAT5e cables with a lenght of 40 foot max. Even though the 10G speed is perfectly stable, I will upgrade the cables to CAT6 to meet the minimum requirements for 10G Ethernet speed.\n\nFiles copy between PCs are at full 1GB/s speed using NVMe drives. Of course, I get slower speed with SATA SSDs or HDD drives. For internet speed, I always get the full speed that the Bell Giga Hub gets because the LAN is not limited to a slower speed.\n\nThe TP-Link TX401 will auto negociate with slower LAN speeds (100Mbps, 1Gbps, 2.5Gbps, 5Gbps). I tested it with an older TRENDnet TEG-S350 2.5GbE switch and it works just fine at 2.5G speed.\n\nSo far, so good. Very happy with the result."

The inconsistency regarding the 16x lines slot remains a mystery to me.\n\nOverall, I'm highly satisfied with the card's performance on my motherboard.

        "review": "TP-Link manufactures quality networking gear. Over recent years, I have relied on a TP-Link modem and I currently running TWO TP-Link routers, one as a 'root' router, the other as an 'extender/bridge' router. Always rock-solid and reliable. (I retired the TP-Link modem only because TP-Link does not manufacture a stand-alone DOCSIS 3.1 modem.)\n\nNote that there has been, over the years, four versions/itinerations of this (1 Gigabit PCI-Express) card. Sold and shipped by Amazon, I received Version 4.6 of the card. So Amazon is selling (direct) and shipping current stock. You can check the version of the card by looking at the label on the outside of the box … or at the sticker on the card. Oddly, the MAC address is not given on either the box or the card; if you need it, you will have to snag it out of your router's DHCP list.\n\nInstallation into a WinXP SP3 w/ circa-2007 Intel mobo was quick and straightforward:\n\nAll the drivers come in the box on a mini-CD but to be sure I would be current, I instead downloaded the most current Version 4 XP drivers from the TP-Link support webpage for the card. That was a .ZIP file; I extracted all the files into a temporary folder. Powered down the computer. Snapped the card into a vacant PCI-Express x 1 slot on the mobo. Powered back up and got the \"Welcome to the Found New Hardware Wizard\" pop-up. The XP driver install instructions provided by TP-Link (at their website) were very close, but not entirely 100% spot-on; if I recall correctly, from the pop-up I followed the path:\n\nInstallFromAListOrSpecificLocation\nDon'tSearchIWillChooseTheDriverToInstall\nHardwareType (choose NetworkAdapter)\nDon't bother to choose a specific adapter from the given list, instead click on\nHaveDisk, then Browse (to the .inf file in the temporary folder), then Open it.\nClick on OK. Ignore incorrect driver warnings and click ContinueAnyway.\n\n(I think the warning is being 'thrown' by the fact that the TP-Link card is built on a Realtek chip & drivers.)\n\nBam! Device and drivers installed. Device is named 'TP-Link Gigabit PCI Express Adapter.' The three needed driver files were dropped into the Windows/System32 folder. Swapped the Ethernet cable onto the card. Opened ControlPanel/NetworkConnections. Disabled the mobo Ethernet port, renamed it 'Mobo Ethernet.' Enabled the TP-Link Ethernet port, renamed it 'TP-Link Ethernet.' Deleted the temporary folder. Rebooted the router, just to be sure. Up and running !!\n\nI didn't pick up the download speed improvement I was hoping for, but I've definitely excluded the Ethernet port as a speed constraint. (Paying for 1Gb, pulling 220Mb … time to get a techie out here to test the speed at the coax connector!)\n\nIn any case, this card is very inexpensive … and it is also a quick, easy solution under XP and older mobos."

        "review": "I’m a tech, I beta test tech for various companies. So it’s natural for me to test each piece of tech I acquire. I have a custom built pc with the intel 13900, a 4090 gpu connected using 1gig up and down internet speeds. I started having throttling occur on upload, limiting me to 100meg upload speed. So I started troubleshooting, after a week of testing I decided the weakest link was the built in Ethernet adapter, others reported similar issues with my particular motherboard. So I ordered this unit, I’m always an overkill kind of guy with tech, so getting a 2.5g unit seemed appropriate.\n\nThe unit arrived quickly, and was simple to install. It worked out of the box but of course I went to their website and upgraded drivers. First series of tests show my ping had been cut more than in half from 20 to 8. The speeds were faster slightly than before although a gig is a gig is a gig. That said, I soon encountered the exact same issue of throttled upload. I found it interesting that it seemed to throttle to 100megs give or take a few. At this time I recognized the issue was either my cable, modem or the actual line to my home. I replaced my Ethernet cord with a new one, and since fiber optic doesn’t usually degrade, it’s unlikely a line issue altho it could be a node issue down the line. Armed with the knowledge I had, I reached out and it was discovered my modem was failing. So even tho this unit didn’t specifically solve my issues, it did allow me to find the cause, and since it is a better ping, that to me is worth the cost of this card. Plus it gives me a backup connection if needed. I will be keeping this card and I will update once I get my new modem, and witness the difference real time. Should I encounter issues going forward I will also update this review.\n\nUltimately I like this adapter, it’s super simple to install and use and it did improve my connection ping and speeds. If I ever use it to transfer data locally I will also post an updated review on that."

        "review": "Ho comprato questo prodotto per aggiornare la scheda di rete di un vecchio pc la quale non era Gigabit ma solo Fastethernet. La differenza tra fastethernet e gibabit é la velocitá di trasferimento dati che per la scheda fastethernet é pari 10/100 mbs mentre per la scheda di rete Gibabit puo'arrivare sino a 1000 mbs laddove anche gli altri comp[onenti hardware della rete siano dotati di porte ethernet Gibabit. La scheda é di piccola dimensioni e si monta negli slot pci x1 o x4 della scheda madre del pc. A differenza di altre schede quindi, questa non richiede uno slot pci express x16. Per capirci, gli slot pci express x16, sono quelli di maggiori dimensioni in cui solitamente si installano le schede grafiche dedicate o le schede audio dedicate mentre gli slot x1 o x4 sono quelli piú piccoli posti normalmente al fianco degli slot pci express x16. La scheda non richiede alimentazione autonoma, ma viene alimentata dalla scheda madre. Nella confezione olte alla scheda e ad un minicd contenente i driver forniti dal produttore, troverete, una piccola staffa in metallo, che vi consentirá di installare la scheda nei case mini-itx, laddove ne possediate uno. In difetto, la scheda é installabile dall'utente in tutti i case midle tower e full tower. Il controller della scheda di rete é Realtek ( quindi Tpc link é il produttore della scheda ma non del processore che la controlla), e viene identificata nel pannello di controllo di Windows 7 ( voce Gestione dispositivi - schede di rete ) come Gigabit Realtek family Controller. Si tratta di un controller economico montato quasi sempre sui pc preassemblati piu'recenti,. Il prodotto in questione é un prodotto economico non certo quidi di alto livello e le prestazioni velocistiche nel trasferimento dei dati tra pc collegati in rete riflettono esattamente il fatto che il controller sia un entry level, poiché, nonostante io possegga un router con porte gigabit, la velocitá della mia rete cablata con cavo rj 45 tra due pc non supera i i 40/50 mbs di media, raggiungendo picchi sporadici di 60 mbs. Si tratta di un buon risultato che soddisferá sicuramente l'utente medio e meno l'utente enthusiast o comunque colui il quale abbia necessitá di utilizzare la rete per fini professionali o semi professionali che , al contrario, esige grande celeritá nel trasferimento dei volumi di dati. Se si sta scegliendo, pertanto, una scheda di rete, avendo come unico obiettivo le prestazioni velocistiche nel trasferimento dati, bisognerebbe dirigere l'attenzione verso prodotti piu'costosi con controller Intel i quali risultano in assoluto i migliori ma che purtroppo costano il triplo rispetto alla scheda oggi recensita. Attenzione quindi a determinare prima e con attenzione il risultato che vi aspetterete dalla configurazione della vostra rete (Lan), poiché se state mirando alle prestazioni pure, alla velocitá, dovete dirigervi verso altri prodotti ben piu'costosi, se, al contrario, volete solo aggiornare un vecchio pc, sprovvisto di porta ethernet gigabite e vi accontentate di buone velocitá di trasferimento dati ma che, tuttavia, non sono velocitá da ''prima della classe'' allora il prodotto in questione é quello giusto per voi. Una precisazione; quando parlo di velocitá nel trasferimento dati, mi riferisco al tempo impiegato ad esempio per trasferire con la funzione ''copia ed incolla'' una cartella o un file da un pc ad un altro pc collegato nella stessa rete, non mi rifersico invece alla velocitá di navigazione internet poiché, laddove il vostro modem o router sia collegato al pc tramite cavo di rete ethernet o comunque tramite wireless, la velocitá di download o upload ( cioé di scaricamento e caricamento dati) dipende dal vostro Provider di servizi Internet ( Tim, Vodafon, Fastweb, ecc) non certamente dalla scheda di rete ethernet che non possiede alcuna incidenza sotto questo profilo.\nPer quanto riguarda l'installazione, molti utenti riferiscono che il sistema operativo Windows 7 abbia cercato automaticamente i driver per il prodotto, dopo aver rilevato la scheda alla prima accensione successiva alla sua intallazione. Ció é avvenuto anche nel mio caso ma l'operazione non é andata a buon fine e la scheda non ha funzionato correttamente. Quindi ho disinstallato il driver generici installati da Windows Update in automatico, ho riavviato il sistema operativo, avendo cura previamente di spegnere il modem ed, una volta raggiunto il desktop, ho insallato i driver forniti dal produttore con il disco di installazione (mini-cd) che accompagna la scheda di rete. Tutto é andato bene e la scheda funziona correttamente sotto Windows 7 a 64 bit versione professional. Molti utenti inoltre, affermano che sotto Windows 10 , i driver siano preinstallati nel sistema operativo e che pertanto la scheda, una volta installata, venga riconosciuta senza necessitá di alcun ulteriore download od operazione da parte dell'utente. Personalmente non posso confermare né smentire poiché, come giá detto, io l'ho testata esclusivamente sotto sistema operativo windows 7. In alcuni casi la scheda di rete aggiuntiva rispetto a quella nativa giá installata all'interno della madre puó andare in conflitto con quest'ultima; per tali evenienze é necessario disabilitare la schede di rete dal bios ( voce: on board lan) oppure dalla pannello di controllo di windows ( voce : Gestioni dispositivi- Schede di rete - Disabilita dispositivo o Disintalla Dispositivo). affinché la scheda di rete aggiuntiva possa funzionare correttamente. Nel mio caso non é stato necessario disabilitare nulla, la scheda di rete Gigabit Realtek di TpLink funziona perfettamente anche senza disabilitare la mia vecchia ethernet con velocitá Fast (10-100) e, pertanto, adesso posseggo doppia uscita di rete. Nella staffa di metallo che sorregge la scheda di rete vera e propria sono integrati tre led verdi che si accendono quando la scheda é in funzione ed incominciano a lampeggiare ad intermittenza, per segnalare il passaggio dei dati. Il prodotto é buono ed economico e lo consiglio per un utilizzo medio, per i palati piu'esigenti, cioé gli utenti appassionati di informatica ed elettronica, nonché per coloro che vogliano un prodotto da adibire ad utilizzi piu'impegnativi o professionali, invece, consiglio di guardare altrove, innalazndo chiaramente il budget di spesa ( i chipset di rete Intel sono un'ottima alternativa). Il prodotto é arrivato molto velocemente, ha impiegato solo 3 giorni e mi é stato consegnato dal corriere Bartolini. Non posso attribuire piu'di 4 stelle, non perché abbia trovato dei veri dfietti nel prodotto ma semplicemente perché si tratta di un prodotto economico, dalle funzionalitá e dalle prestazioni basiche, adeguate all'utente medio ed il cui prezzo é pienamente conforme a quanto offerto. A mio giudizio per attribuirgli 5 stelle sarebbe stato ncessario riscontrare funzionalitá e caratteristiche straordinarie in relazione al prezzo di acquisto che questo prodotto non possiede, pur non deludendo sotto alcun punto di vista. Segnalo comunque la presenza tra le funzionalitá aggiuntive della scheda di rete, l'opzione ''wake on lan'' la quale deve essere previamente abilitata, consentendo di risvegliare un pc che sia in stato di sospensione o ibernazione mediante l'utilizzo di un altro pc facente parte della stessa rete. Per sfruttare questa opzione, peró sono necessarie 4 condizioni: la prima é che il computer che si intenda risvegliare sia dotato di SCHEDA DI RETE ethernet con funzione '' wake on lan'', la seconda condizione é che la SCHEDA MADRE del computer da risvelgiare supporti la funzione '' wake on lan'' , ( anche essa attivabile dal bios), la terza condizione é che il computer da risvegliare NON SIA SPENTO ma solo in stato di sospensione o ibernazione, la quarta condizione é che il computer da risvelgiare e quello risvegliante FACCIANO PARTE DELLA STESSA RETE. Se non ricorrono tutte le 4 condizioni sopraelencate, la funzione wake on lan non é utilizzabile. Spesso con il termine ''wake on lan', negli articoli suyl web, viene identificato anche il procedimento di accensione a distanza di un pc spento (e non solo posto in stato di sospensione o ibernazione) nonché l'accensione a distanza di un pc spento mediante l'utilizzo di un pc risvegliante che non faccia parte della stessa rete Lan. Tale terminologia é inesatta, comuqnue per vostra consocenza, potrebbe risultare utile sapere che l'accensione a distanza sia di un pc completamente spento sia di un pc non facente parte della stessa rete é procedimento ben piu'complesso della ''wake on lan'' pura, poiché richiede l'utilizzo di appositi software, spesso molto costosi, esige naturalmente la scheda di rete e la scheda madre del pc da risvegliare con funzione wake on lan ed, infine, richiede conoscenze approfondite sul funzionamento delle reti telematiche di cui l'utente medio é ignaro."

The problem was in not keeping the original drivers it comes with and dont update them. The updated drivers would only allow me 1450 down and 1150 up speeds. Make sure your router can handle the 2.5 gig since most cannot. Some have a 2.5 gig port in coming but in most that is the only port that works at 2.5 gig and its not an out going port. Most outgoing are only 1 gig speed rated since most services are not much more. After some tweaking and playing with the drivers the speed is 2350 both up and down. Took a bit but I am finally happy with this and getting the speeds I was promised. The install is super easy and the drivers load easily also."

The entire picture that the device receives is shifted up by 1 pixel, and the bottom row of pixels is actually a copy of the pixels above it. If you get this product, then perform a test: make a 1080x1920 image with a black background, and 1 white pixel in every corner. If you display the image full-screen, you will notice that the top 2 do not show up. I performed that test with 2 different graphics cards, and it has the same result.\n\nIt also does not work well with HDMI outputs. My computer supports hotswapping monitors, but this display seems like it doesn't. I should have taken the hint when people had to configure their raspberry pi in a special way to use this. I tried this with multiple computers. For the majority of them, it would not even display anything. Other monitors worked with those computers.\n\nI returned the first one I got, they gave me the same one back, I returned it again, and finally they gave me an actually new one, and it had 100% of the prior problems.\n\nAside from the missing top row, the picture quality is decent when it works.\n\nThey at least contacted me via email after the second return, and I'll be following up to clarify the problems. So, they are trying to do good. I may try one of their other products and hope it behaves differently. Look at their website. They have a lot more information about their products there, including the physical dimensions of each display and how to get it working with your pi."

        "review": "Note that this device only advertises 1080 x 1920 (portrait) resolution, not 1920 x 1080 (landscape) resolution, to the host. So unless you're using a device with an operating system smart enough to support display rotation, it will be operating in portrait mode--not what most users will probably expect, and enough to make some embedded systems fail silently when they can't find a 1920 x 1080 display. The monitor has no power/status LEDs or on-screen indicators, so it's hard to tell whether it's powered off, powered on but receiving no signal, or powered on but receiving a blank image. It also wasn't immediately clear how to turn it on. It comes with no documentation. I connected it to an HDMI source, pressed the power button, and nothing happened. Eventually I figured out to hold down the power button for a few seconds, this made it show a display for a moment, then turn off. I held the power button down again for a few seconds and it stayed on. The enclosure feels fairly solid for the price and the display looks nice, but it needs some better status indicators and it would be ten times more useful if there were a way to tell it to switch to 1920 x 1080 resolution. And a piece of paper explaining how to turn it on."

        "review": "I have been using two monitors for ages, over the last five years I have been using 34\" ultra wide monitors paired with a 27\" 16x9 monitor, but I decided to try something new and purchased a Samsung CRG9 for gaming. After a couple of days, I was really missing my second display. I usually used it for keeping an eye on my temperatures and clocks while I'm gaming.\nNeedless to say, I thought a portable laptop screen might do the trick. Since it was just for displaying monitoring software I did not need anything high quality or fancy, so I ordered this 15\" Koorui.\nFirst oops was that I didn't realize my GPU did not have a USBc, but no problem since they also supplied an HDMI cable...oops again, there is no power adapter for the USBc cable...lucky I have a USBc on my motherboard, but they really need to include a power adapter with the monitor.\nInitial inspection was much better than I thought it would be. The monitor feels a little premium, possibly due to the folio cover.\nPowering on the device brought up the picture, and I was a little underwhelmed. The picture is slightly dull...just slightly. I tried adjusting the brightness and contrast, but it's as good as it gets. It's not bad really since I'm comparing it to the $1100 monitor above it, but it does do the job of displaying my monitoring software splendidly.\n\nA couple of beefs. First, it would have been nice if the cables were longer. I had to use my own USBc cable because the one they provide is only about three feet long.\nThe second is that they, like the rest of the manufacturers, put the ports on the side of the display like a tablet.\nCome on guys, this is a monitor, not a tablet. As you can see in the picture, the ports sticking out the side are an ugly quality of life issue could easily have been avoided. Recessing them in the back would have been perfect, but having them sticking out the back would hvae been fine as well. Anything but sticking out the side like this.\n\nOther than that, it's the little monitor that could. It's working perfectly for the purpose I bought it for. Having it set up this way though, if I had to make the choice again, for this particular usage I would have picked a 14\" model. The 15\" is a touch too big for this purpose.\n\nIn any case, if this monitor turns out to be reliable then it's easily worth the price I paid ($117 + Tax). I would recommend it for this purpose."

        "review": "For budget gamers like me who are also casual gamers, I got some tips to improve your experience with this monitor. Obviously for the price you will get what you pay for. However, you can still very much enjoy medium pace competitive gaming with the adequate tweaks in-game as well as in the monitor settings. I have enjoyed 60hz monitor experience for most of my time gaming and you should expect smoother gameplay as well as slightly more in-depth/ less pixelated video quality. That being said, there are limits to what games you can play. Using this monitor works well for me for Rainbow 6 Siege and Read Dead Redemption 2. I doubt playing fast pace triple-A games like Warzone will work with this monitor. Important to mention, after spending a few hours on this monitor I have gotten used to the ghosting where it seems not apparent to me anymore or it's so minimal. Just a warning though, do expect poor video quality to compensate for better motion. But overall in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the cons in my book. You sacrifice some video quality for more smooth motion as well as high refresh rate.\n\nSteps to fix ghosting issues:\n- Set contrast and brightness on monitor to 100/ max\n- Turn on overdrive (OD) to extreme\n- Turn on freesync premium and enable g sync in nvidia control panel\n- Use Gamma 1 because you need that high contrast\n- Ensure you use the 165hz in your windows setting as well as in-game setting\n- In-game limit your fps to 165hz or unlimited\n- In the nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings: turn low latency mode to ultra and power management mode to prefer maximum performance.\n\nNow this part is subjective to users:\n- In-game test out contrast and sharpness to near maximum effectiveness. You can over-saturate these effects which can become negatively impactful.\n- In-game adjust brightness accordingly where you can see shades from black to white appropriately.\n\nIn conclusion, this monitor has been a good upgrade from my 60 hz monitor as it is smoother in gameplay and less pixelated when viewing from further distances. A good step forward from entry level gaming on a budget. Although setting up tweaks for games for the first time and later on will be an inconvenience but well worth it if you don't mind."

The only thing you will need is how to plug the usb to a power outlet. I didn’t need one because I already have one on my desk. I don’t do any design or any activities that require colour calibration, so the brightness and colours seem perfect to me. Connecting it was super easy and straight forward, no need to configure anything. The speakers are also pretty decent, and the monitor has a volume button on the right side next to the power button. If you push up, it will show the volume menu and if you push down it will first show the mode menu. From there you can choose: Standard, cinema, RTS, FPS or eye saver."

        "review": "Out of the box the fit and finish and magnetic flap/stand all feel very high quality.\n\nWithout reading the manual (which wouldn't have helped anyway), I figured out how to plug it in and get it up and running in Windows 11. Pretty intuitive and well integrated process.\n\nMy 13 inch HP spectre has 2 USB-c ports. This monitor also has 2 USB-c ports. A single cable between them will work with any pair of ports. however in that case the brightness is limited at 50% due to power limitation. By connecting the laptop charger to the Koorui monitor, and with a single USB-c cable leading back to the laptop, there's no longer any power limitation and I can get 100% brightness and 100% volume. The pleasant surprise for me was the single display cable, also *back charges* the laptop, although at a low wattage. I can leave the laptop in high performance mode, and the battery drains only very very slowly and can last at least 2 days.\n\nI bought two of these Koorui's, the second one used HDMI to mini HDMI with Windows 10, on an eight year old laptop. That also worked flawlessly. However, a second USB-c power source was needed to turn on the monitor at all (which it would do at full power), because HDMI doesn't deliver power.\n\nThese Koorui monitor feel more comfortable to read than either of my laptops (one of which is a high end 4k screen). It has a matte finish and nice looking black to white transitions, making photos look very natural. I really like the colors and reading experience.\n\nThe only downside I found was the manual. It repeats hazard warning in six languages, but doesn't tell you you need to hold down the power button for a few seconds to turn it on, because the power button doubles as menu and select button. The entire monitor settings UI is handled with only 3 buttons. It work well once you figure it out, but the \"manual\" doesn't have a single mention of any of this. Nor does it discuss compatibility and power requirements. Why try so hard at making a great product, but remain at such an amateur level writing the manual? That's the thing that bugged me.\n\nFor gaming you only get 60hz refresh, so I haven't tried it for gaming and don't plan to use it that way. For remote learning and remote meetings, a highly portable second screen is a really nice thing to have. Overall for the extremely friendly price, I really appreciate being able to purchase this product."

It was a bit confusing to set up as you need to connect two cords but it works great!\n\nI wanted to use it at home as a third monitor and bought an adaptor to do so. Unfortunately, it flickers on and off. It’s possible my computer (Dell i5 Inspiron) doesn’t have enough processing power to support 3 screens in total. When I choose my next computer I will make sure it works. It’s a great little screen and the resolution is fantastic!"

        "review": "This monitor is really nice. It comes with a neoprene storage sleeve, and two cables - an HDMI cable and a USB-C cable. The monitor works with USB-C to USB-C, or it works with HDMI. However, if you connect with HDMI, then you need a USB-C to USB-A cable (not supplied) to provide power to the monitor (so you have two cables going into the monitor). The picture quality is good and sharp. The brightness is good too. The stand is ok. It doesn't feel the most sturdy, but if you keep the monitor horizontal then it feels pretty good. When I put the monitor vertical with the stand, it feels a bit shaky and I don't trust it. I would probably use some other stand if I want to keep the monitor in vertical (portrait) orientation. The monitor is also slim and light, so it's easy to travel around. There were no dead pixels when the monitor arrived, and the colour was close to my laptop screen (not perfect, but good enough as long as you're not doing graphical work where calibration is required). The menu button at the back of the monitor feels a bit cheap, but it does the job that it needs to do. Overall this is a great monitor - even better if you can get it on sale!"

With a smartphone you can get by using the included type-c for data transfer and power, however, it will drain your phones battery at a decent pace. To avoid this, you can power the monitor with a usb type-c cable in one port, and use another type c port on the monitor for data transfer. (Make sure to use included cable and another good quality type-c cable) It connects flawlessly to my beelink mini pc. On which I have used it for light pc gaming; apex, forza, counter strike and everyday surfing and browsing. The pc worked flawlessly and only needed the provided type-c cable for power AND data transfer. The included mini hdmi will pair perfectly with my ps5 aswell. Can you say gaming on the go? Was so happy with my purchase I did an unboxing for it. For price/performance. I definitely recommend."

        "review": "This is a review of VA1655(Standard Version), I also purchased the premium version VG1655 as well.\nPurchased as an Used-Like New at $83.99(compared to $129) from ViewSonic Corp. After a week of using, for the summary, this is a mediocre portable monitor. It's probably not worth spend over $100 on this.\nThere are two main reasons you should avoid this monitor.\n\nColor Gamut & Luminance:\n1.Limited Color Gamut .(about 58.25% sRGB Coverage). For the sub $100 , you can buy a 24-inch IPS Panel Monitor(Normal PC Monitor) with 99% sRGB coverage.\n2.Limited LCD Luminance(About 257.51 cd/m^2) For Monitor under 300 cd/m^2,it will be very hard to read outdoor.\n\nColor Accuracy:\nApart from two main drawbacks, the color accuracy is also very poor. Under the factory default settings. The average ΔE*00 is 5.16 (Normal range ≤1.5 ), the max ΔE*00=21.83(Normal range≤4). It's extremely poor on displaying blue color.\n\nCompared to Premium Version(VG1655)\nDisplay Panel:\nIt also has a premium version, after analyzing it, I must say it's complete wasting money, the display panels is almost identical, similar Color Gamut and color accuracy. The premium version has a slightly brighter luminance 288 cd/m^2 compared to 257.51 cd/m^2.\n\nI/O ports and Appearance:\nIn additional to the identical panel, the features seems identical too, same I/O ports configuration. Despite the standard one showing two icons for usb-c ports: usb-c power and usb-c display. After testing, they are actually the same , both can be using as USB-C display ports. The standard one has the lock port though.\nThe big differences between the standard and premium is the appearance .The premium has the metal frame and metal back cover(plastic frame and back cover on standard one), and support is a big full metal piece compared small plastic one on standard. They can both stand vertically at same angle. The stand version come with a monitor sleeve bag covered the whole monitor whereas the premium has the magnetic cover which only cover half of it. The standard weight lighter than the premium .\n\nAccessories:\nBoth models come with 1 USB-c to USB-C cable, Full HDMI to Mini HDMI cable. For the premium one, it has one extra USB-A to USB-C cable and a Power adapter. Other than that, they are very similar. Since I already mentioned the bag and cover in the Appearance, I won't mention again.\n\nConclusion:\nThe standard VA1655 is worth to consider buying when below $100. For the premium VG1655, it's totally waste the money when spending over $20 or more for the identical performance. Not to mention the sound speakers are identical too. You won't get any better sound on premium one. I only recommend to buy the monitor for the everyday usage like school or office."

        "review": "I bought the ViewSonic VA1655 last week and received it a few days ago. Here is an early review after connecting it to my stuff.\n\nSharpness:\nThe display is full HD, so it looks fairly sharp. It won't be as sharp as the retina displays of my 14-inch MacBook Pro M! or my 11-inch iPad Pro M2. But I think trying to retina on this portable monitor would be overkill.\n\nBrightness:\nAt work, I use a Chromebook that is rated 220 nits. Its display is bright enough, even in the cubical/office space where many big windows expose lots of sunlight. Since the Viwwsonic VA1655 is rated 250 nits, I expected it would be bright enough. It is. I would not expect to be able to use it if I had a huge beam of direct sunlight on the screen, but frankly, I think I'd have some trouble using my iPad or MacBook that way.\n\nColors:\nI connected the Viewsonic to my MacBook Pro M1, duplicated a photo, and displayed it on the Viewsonic and the MacBook. I did not see a difference. Granted, I am not a photographer, and I am a little colorblind. But I read reviews claiming the colors on the Viewsonic looked washed out, and I did see that. But those with higher standards than mine might want to put in the proper research, since I have read that the Viewsonic color gamut is not real high. Your milage may vary.\n\nGaming:\nI do not play video games, so I cannot judge how well the Viewsonic handles that. I rated gaming at 3 stars to try to be neutral. And I know that not paying video games might damage my geek cred. I still read comic books.\n\nMacBook Pro:\nThe USB-C cable connects to my MacBook Pro and the display and the display instantly shows up. It looks decent side-by-side. Not bad!\n\niPad Pro:\nThe USB-C connection works fine, although I had to find the right Settings and turn on Stage Manager to make the Viewsonic show as an external display without mirroring. I use a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. The mouse is needed to navigate the Viewsonic display (I doubt that a touchscreen portable monitor would have touchscreen functionality with the iPad). But it does drain the iPad battery faster. I can plug power into the extra USB-C port on the monitor to charge the iPad, that works fine.\n\niPad Pro and USB hub:\nI have a USB hub that I use to plug stuff into my iPad (like flash drives and external hard drives or SD drives). When I connected the hub to the iPad Pro, and then connected the USB-C data port on the hub to the Viewsonic, it did not carry a video signal. So I connect the Viewsonic display to the USB hub like this:\n1. Bluetooth-connect my external keyboard and mouse to the iPad.\n2. To power the Viewsonic, connect a USB-A-to-USB-C cable to a USB 3.0 port on the hub, then to the USB-C port on the Viewsonic.\n3. To carry the video signal, connect the Viewsonic HDMI cable to the hub, and then to the Viewsonic mini HDMI port.\n4. Optional: Plug power into the USB-C PD (power delivery) port on the hub to supply power to the iPad.\n5. Connect the hub to the iPad USB-C port.\nFrom this experience, my advice is if you buy a portable monitor, buy one with an HDMI port, two USB-C ports, and an audio port. I have used them on my Viewsonic VA1655. (Except the audio port, but I am sure it works.)\n\nAudio:\nThe speakers sound tinny, but I did not expect good sound from them anyhow.\nWhen I connect the Viewsonic to my MacBook Pro, I select the MacBook Pro speakers for better sound.\nWhen I plug the Viewsonic into the iPad, the iPad audio automatically switches to the Viewsonic speakers with no option to switch back to the iPad speakers. (I believe this would happen with any portable monitor.) If I want better sound, I can connect to one of my Bluetooth speakers and switch to it. Or I could plug a speaker or headphones into the Viewsonic audio port.\n\nThe little kickstand:\nSome reviews comment that the kickstand can break easily. I take that into account when I pull the kickstand out, I open it with care. I get my fingers in underneath, close to the hinge, to avoid stress on that hinge. The kickstand works well, the little rubber feet grip smooth surfaces well (in landscape orientation). The Viewsonic is steady enough on a flat surface in landscape orientation, but portrait is kinda tippy (I am unlikely to use portrait anyhow).\n\nWeight and Sturdiness:\nThe Viewsonic VA1655 display is lightweight, which feels nice. It makes my old 22-inch display (lower resolution, so iPad would only allow mirrored display) feel like a boat anchor (I will donate it somewhere). The Viewsonic does feel plasticy, because it is made of plastic. No metal frame to sturdy it up. However, It does not feel flimsy. I keep it in the included pouch when not in use.\n\niPad as a MacBook:\nThe Viewsonic monitor and the USB hub will let me use the iPad more like a MacBook, which I am likely to do if I have to take my MacBook Pro into the shop. I can plug other devices into the hub, like a USB flash drive or an external hard drive or SD drive, but I have read that it is best to not plug too much into the hub at once. I have read that can overwork the iPad USB-C port and give the iPad a heart attack.\n\nPrice:\nI bought the Viewsonic VA1655 for about about $100 (normally $140), so it was a very good deal. I am happy with it."

        "review": "I've only had this monitor for about a week, but I've already used it in so many different ways....\n\nI primarily work from home and I like to move around the house throughout my workday. Unfortunately, to be efficient in what I do, I really need at least two screens most of the time. I have two large full-size monitors in my home offiice, but they're bulky and a pain to move around. I recently read an article saying that single-board computer maker OrangePi was releasing a portable monitor and I was intrigued. That lead me to start looking at options.\n\nAs it turns out, there are a ton of portable monitors on the market, many cheaper than this one, but most of the ones I saw were from no-name manufacturers and I was concerned about their quality. In the end, I narrowed down my options to this one and one made by Asus. ViewSonic is a brand that I've know and trusted since the days of CRTs and, while I've never owned an Asus monitor before, I've been a big fan of their motherboards for many years. The Asus monitor, however, only had USB-C input, which made it a deal breaker, so I went with the ViewSonic.\n\nThe monitor is roughly the size and thickness of a laptop screen. It has a kickstand on the back that allows it to be positioned at any viewing angle. There are two USB-C ports, one mini HDMI port, and an 1/8\" audio jack on the left side, a status LED on the right side, and two small speakers and a single four-way rocker button to control the settings on the back. The package included a 3ft USB-C cable, a 4ft HDMI to mini HDMI cable, and a Neoprene storage sleeve.\n\nI bought this monitor mainly to use with my newer MacBook that I have for for work, but I also planned to use it with my older personal MacBook which only has a mini DisplayPort/Thunderbolt connector on it, which is why the HDMI input was important to me. With USB-C the monitor can pull power from the device it's connected to, but it can also be powered on it's own with a simple phone charger via the second USB-C port. HDMI connections don't provide power, so a power adapter is needed when using the HDMI port. The power adapter is not included, but pretty much any recent phone charger will do.\n\nSo, I said this thing has been extremely versatile, right? How have I been using it? Well...\n\nMy initial plan was to use it to work from the kitchen table, which I've been doing. I usually start my day by looking over my email and Slack message while I eat breakfast and now I can do that more efficiently by not having to move windows around as I look up things to form my email replies.\n\nI've also found it useful to work from the couch in the evening. I set up the monitor on the end table and connect it to my laptop on my lap and I can easily take care of a bunch of the administrative busywork that I need to do while I watch TV. Doing this has let me stay more focused on meaningful work during the day.\n\nI can also connect my Samsung phone to this monitor and, with Samsung's DeX feature and a Bluetooth keyboard, I can use my phone as a full desktop. I admittedly don't have a ton of use for this, but it's still kind of cool. The phone's battery can power the screen if I want, but if I connect a charger to the second USB-C port on the screen will actually feed power back to my phone to keep it charged.\n\nDuring the winter, I have my bike set up on a trainer in my basement and I have a book holder that I attach to the handlebars to put my tablet on so I can stream TV while I ride. Well, now that I have this monitor, I can connect it to a Roku and have a much better view than I get from an 8\" tablet screen. Unfortunately the trainer makes a lot of noise, so I have to use headphones in order to hear anything. On the tablet I use my Bluetooth headphones, but that's not an option with this, so I'm going to have to look for some kind of Bluetooth adapter.\n\nAnd finally, just yesterday one of my Raspberry Pis stopped responding. Rather than pulling the plug on it to reboot it and hope for the best, I connected this monitor and a keyboard to it and was able to diagnose the problem and do a safe reboot rather than a hard power down.\n\nSo, as you can see, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. So far I've used the screen on my newer MacBook via USB-C directly, my older MacBook via a Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter, a Windows laptop via HDMI, a Roku Express via HDMI, and a Raspberry Pi via HDMI. All have worked flawlessly and I haven't had to touch any settings (other than volume). Color and brightness are good and the screen seems pretty responsive, though I've only used it for web browsing, business apps, Zoom calls, and a little bit of Netflix.\n\nMy only complaint is with the sound. The speakers are way too small to be very useful and the volume control, witch requires clicking through a couple of menus in the settings panel, is hard to access. It'd be nicer if the speakers were moved to the front or sides of the unit so that the sound would at least be projected toward you, and it would be nice to have dedicated volume control buttons to make adjusting easier, but I can't really complain given that 99% of the time I'll be using the speakers on whatever the monitor is connected to rather than the monitor itself.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a second monitor for a laptop (or anything else for that matter), you can't go wrong with this one."

I set a paper towel on the CPU heat sink and mocked up the fan. I saw that there was maybe 1/32” to the components on the display. I shimmed that with folded paper, then glued (Goat Tuff archery glue) the fan to the pin header. The Pi was still running warm with the case perimeter on. I removed it, and drilled a bunch of holes where there was no interference for air to flow. It now runs nice and cool, and I’ll have a friend with a nice soldering kit & a steady hand finalize the mod. If anyone can tell me how to dim this thing, I’d appreciate it."

That said, GPIO pinout is the same on both devices as far as this screen is concerned. I got tired of hunting for a monitor and HDMI cable.\n\nOnce you follow the instructions (clone git repo, run script for your screen size) it will reboot and you'll be good to go. Booted with a tty console, too (no GUI on my devices). Note that text is not super clear and especially on a console will be very tiny by default (this can be changed at the OS level)\n\nThere's been some fairly negative reviews recently, but following the instructions on the business card-sized driver installation guide included in the box will get you setup right away. And at this size, an increase in DPI would not do much to improve text readability. I've got a 3.5\" lcd which has a (horizontally oriented) resolution of 800x450 which cost 6 times what this screen does and text is only slightly easier to read."

The other part of that coin is I have no interest in grasping it either, a factor that's on me more than the products. As kits for STEM classes and such I can see where they are so useful as to be a mainstay, as well as totally changing computer technology, giving birth to the mini, fanless units taking over.

        "review": "I bought this case with the intention of making a point and shoot style thermal camera. The project ended up being a success, but I found that the screen is a real GPIO hog. My specific issue was that it uses all of your default I2C headers. Other folks who actually know what they're doing can probably work around this limitation with good circuit design, but since I'm an IT guy and not an engineer I had to make my hack work in software. This is by no means a fault with this case, and I am very happy with the finished product.\n\nThe screen is very responsive and worked well with a default raspberry pi image after following the included instructions. I did find that after installing the screen's drivers, my external monitors started reporting \"out of range\", which I am sure is something that can be worked around in software. It wasn't critical for my application, so I didn't bother.\n\nAssembly was pretty easy, but there is no wiggle room. Since my build involved a few wires that needed to exit the case to reach my sensor, it was an extremely tight fit. Assembly doesn't leave much room for anything besides the screen.\n\nThe only thing that I can say could use improvement would be to use a screen that exposes the GPIO pins so that things like sensors can be attached for noobs like me who can't design circuits yet. That would make it a little more user friendly, but also understandably raise the price.\n\nOverall, extremely happy with the product and would buy again for other projects without reservation."

It would function with a fresh installation but that would require reinstalling reams of programs I had spent months working on. After a week of searching for a solution, I finally came upon a hint after viewing the output of the dmesg command. There in the \"kernel\" section was snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=0\nI opened a terminal in the /boot directory and typed sudo nano cmdline.txt and added snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=1 to the end of the line alt-x to exit \"Y\" to save, enter to accept the file save then reboot. After reboot right-clicking the speaker icon allowed me to select headphones for output. Good luck. YMMV since I could not state what else I'd done previous to that trying to get it working (any of which may have also contributed to the end result)."

This screen is probably around 300-350 NITs at peak brightness, and is best suited for indoors. When executing the main installation command, don't forget to change the I2C bus to “1” instead of the default “0” as indicated on the waveshare readme. This allows the waveshare screen POGO pins to connect to the I2C “1” bus for touchscreen for use with RPi4B. Edit your RPi config.txt file after installation via Terminal-> sudo nano /boot/config.txt and delete or comment out the \"ignore_lcd=1\" at the bottom. You should also add to bottom of config.txt the following line to prevent RPi video output problems; display_default_lcd=1. The waveshare brightness application may work on the stock RPI image, however it does not work on the custom RPI 4B 64bit image I used. You can manually change the brightness through the following terminal commands instead:\nsudo chmod 777 /sys/waveshare/rpi_backlignt/brightness\necho *> /sys/waveshare/rpi_backlignt/brightness #where * is a value 0-240"

I cracked the glass trying to push it onto the board.\n\nData sheet suggests that the controller supports 4 colors and 64 shades of brightness for each color, but the included code doesn't give examples for this, only black/white. Not sure whether the display itself supports multicolor or not. Other panels that use this controller support white, yellow, blue, and black.\n\nThere are other features mentioned in the data sheet that there are no examples for in the software, like \"dim mode\" and \"low power mode.\" Would be nice to have examples for these.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice little display."

        "review": "In the past, the main drawback of TFT technology has been the low contrast. Using In-Plane-Switching (IPS), the color is induced in the same plane as the backlight (The term would be wrong in this case, as the light plane is no longer behind the color plane), resulting in very high contrast. This display looks like an OLED display, without the drawbacks of color-fading over time, and price. Driver software is widely available - in the picture I'm using the sample from circuitpython for this chip. So far I have only driven the SPI at 24 Mhz, which the driver chip handles without hiccup. With the high contrast, this 2 inch display is as readable as bigger displays. The resolution of 240x320 gives fine detail, but obviously requires longer for screen refresh, so it's a trade off. For me, IPS displays will be the choice if available, and this display does not disappoint. The board allows for through-hole soldering of your own wires, and the supplied connector with breadboard friendly wires makes prototyping a snap, no soldering required. I will probably use this display for my final result, but will take the connector off, as it requires too much space below the display board.\nI tested several displays of different sizes and technologies. So far this is my favorite. What I haven't done yet is a power consumption comparison. When only few pixels are \"active\", OLED would usually consume less power, but I will see how it pans out."

The picture quality is fantastic at 2K, not as sharp as some of the 4k ones we tested but 2k at this price is a really fantastic work monitor for those that work doing online/digital marketing and dealing with photos, images, branding elements as part of their work. The really nice surprise was the benefits of USB-C/Thunderbolt. Have this monitor as an extended desktop on a MacBook Pro connected via USB-C/Thunderbolt and went from a power cable, monitor cable, desktop webcam cable and external USB drive cable down to just the USB-C/Thunderbolt. All of those components are now directly plugged into the monitor and I simply connect my MacBook Pro with one USB-C/Thunderbolt and everything works as before but without any dongles and not nearly the mess of cables. This monitor even provides power to the MacBook Pro via USB-C/Thunderbolt. Great picture quality and fantastic USB-C/Thunderbolt cable management. I'm guessing the 4k version of this monitor is top notch but it is much more expensive than the 2k. If you use a MacBook Pro, this is a fantastic option."

One of them has a bit pinkish White tone so I tried to order another one from Amazon in the hope of swapping with it. It turned out the white tone is even worse with yellowish tone and too much different in White with the 3 ones. I am not sure how pro it is and how these were factory calibrated that cause so much different in White tone even with the same model. So I had to return it.\nSadly. I bought these pro calibrated monitors with the hope for consistency of the multiple monitors set up but I could not achieve that."

As such, I did my due diligence and my pros and cons did not justify the $600+ price difference between this Viewsonic and the BenQ. I use a Herman Miller monitor arm and therefore have no need for the metal base of the BenQ PD3220U (base is metal and stand is plastic). Similarly, a built in KVM switch is a nice to have NOT a must have for me, and lastly, I'm not willing to shell out $1K+ for a display that would soon be outdated by IPS Black or 32 inch 5K offerings (crossed fingers).\nIn light of that, I've used Viewsonic CRT monitors at work in the 90s but this is the first one I've owned – so far so good (knock on wood). In my experience, the Colorpro VP3256-4K has features and capabilities that closely if not exceed that of the BenQ PD3220U for $600+ less. The only differences I've found between them so far are the built in KVM switch, metal base, and hockeypuck in the BenQ – all of which I could live without but your miles may vary. Good luck!"

I usually order ASUS ProArt or BenQ DesignVue monitors.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent color rendition out of box (SDR only)\n- Sharp (1440p @ 27\")\n- Bright with Uniform brightness throughout panel\n- Good viewing angles\n- Good ergonomics with included stand, including vertical orientation\n- Good heft, not too light. Seems solidly built.\n- OSD buttons easy to use with lots of customization\n- You can turn off the Blue LED Power Button through the OSD (great for photo / video editing)\n- Included Speakers are surprisingly good, better than most Laptop speakers (Good for small room)\n- Included HMDI cable has Ferrite Cores on either end to reduce EMI/RF interference (Good for Unshielded Studio Monitors)\n- Stand easy to install but has VESA mount for wall-mount or monitor arm applications\n\nCons:\n- 8-bit Color\n- 60hz Refresh\n- Does not include DisplayPort or USB-C cable. (I am using with a Desktop, so I can't try the USB-C feature until Discrete Graphic Cards start including them)\n- USB 3 ports on the bottom, also did not come with USB 3 hub cable\n- Included Speakers aren't very loud (quieter than typical flat panel TV sound)\n- Included Speakers do not replace Bookshelf / Studio Monitors by a large margin (this is a given but might as well write that out)\n- Included stand is good, but it does wobble if you lean on the desk or type ferociously\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase."

For basic office work solid option. Color correction not 100% so not the greatest for graphic artwork.\n\nCons:\nThe base and stand is a little tricky to connect to the actual monitor. I would recommend connecting the stand first before adding the base. There is a metal plate on the back of the monitor and you have to be very careful sliding it in, make sure it's at the bottom and you push forward all the way. Much easier when the monitor is laying flat on a surface."

Since I bought this specifically to have use of the speaker function it's a bit disappointing."

        "review": "Great for my personal needs.\nIf you are getting a monitor like this, high refresh rate and higher than FHD don't forget to double check your settings. I've seen a couple reviews that I think could have been solved by double checking this.\n\nBut on to the monitor itself. It's great! Bought it at ~$170 USD. Played games at double the quoted refresh rate and also at 30 fps. I haven't seen any ghosting, though this can happen apparently I may have just been very lucky so far. Refresh rates are great, playing Valorant, CSGO, and Apex hasn't been an issue. Losing gun fights in any of those games have been my own fault and not having hardware lag behind and my reactions not being able to quickly adjust.\n\nIf you aren't playing competitive games and are more looking for a media consumption tool or prioritize picture quality and color accuracy this probably won't be the panel for you. There are better options out there for that specific purpose but if you like to game and consume content this is a great bang for the buck monitor.\n\n1 small gripe I would have, but I understand for the price point it can't really be helped is that the monitor stand that comes with it isn't height adjustable.\nNot a big deal if you are planning on Vesa mounting it but something worth noting.\n\nAlso if you are planning on using this monitor and having sound out there are no on board speakers. Not an issue if you are planning on using headphones or have desk speakers but I have seen other reviews saying they were disappointed at the lack of them. So i figure I'd point that out if you were expecting them.\n\nOverall for I'd recommend this monitor to anyone who needs a great budget gaming monitor. Like I said just make sure to double check your settings, on the monitor and on your PC, when you first plug it in."

        "review": "I got two of these to be the \"wingmen\" for a 27\" Dell U2719 I've had for some years. I wanted a triple monitor setup with the Dell centered, but I have a small desk, so larger monitors were going to overhang the desk sides and cause problems. These Koorui monitors are possibly the narrowest 21.5\" monitor you can buy.\n\nI can report that these are more than adequate, and raise that to fantastic given the price! Comparing them to a Dell Ultrasharp is hardly fair, but they're so close for day-to-day office productivity that I really don't notice. Another bonus is the PPI of 21.5\" FHD to 27\" WQHD is nearly identical. If you understood that, then you know why I think it's great. 😉\n\nSo, the nitpicks:\n\n- kinda crappy blackpoint; would not recommend for movies or production graphics work\n- the VESA mount area is flat at the bottom holes, and curved at the top ones; this means you will have to shim with spacers (I used three nylon washers at each of the top holes) if your VESA mount needs zero pressure to rotate correctly\n- while these have speakers, they're an afterthought: you get what you pay for here\n\nOverall, a superb value for adding some real estate, and a totally acceptable main monitor if you are on a tight budget."

        "review": "I live on a sailboat with 12v power as most efficient options, so was looking for a decent inexpensive monitor that had a \"brick\" that provided 110v to 12v conversion. We eliminated the brick and wire the monitor direct to our 12v circuit breakers. The 12v plug needed seems to be fairly standard as I had previously bought 10 of them to use for other projects. I am NOT gaming or doing any high resolution color-critical work. The screen seems good and the price was outstanding. Though, wish it had built-in speakers. Shipped it to Malaysia where we were and it arrived intact. Amazon handled the duty and paperwork required to get it thru Malaysian Customs without any work on our part."

I have found this monitor works great for me for all these tasks. Let me state that I am not a big time gamer. It allows me enough room and resolution to multitask and enjoy watching a lot of streaming video. I have used many monitors and this is my first curved one and I really like it. Great color, contrast and resolution and brightness....the overall clarity is great and for what I do and I like the 2K resolution. I had never heard of a Koorui monitor before, but took a chance on it because of price and features. So far after a couple of months of use I am very happy with it and only time will prove out its durability. Based on my experience so far I would recommend it to others looking for a nice reasonably priced monitor."

        "review": "This 1080p VP16-OLED portable monitor is nearly perfect, but it does have a few minor annoyances. One great feature is that it can be powered using only a single Type-C cable, either via USB-A or the included power brick. The stand and hinges are solid and can be placed at multiple angles, and for gaming the screen can be rotated to TATE mode using the stand, very convenient. It's very lightweight, making it easy to use as a portable, table/shelf, camper monitor. The screen cover is made of a good quality, velour-like material, but the flaps can be inconvenient to fold in place. It's held in place with magnetic clips and does a good job of protecting the screen, but it takes some time with manipulation.\n\nI like using this monitor for gaming in FPS2 view mode, as the colors look great on it. Retro gaming and Switch games look good on this OLED screen, although some gaming emulation devices with 720p output may fit better once overscan is turned on. One issue I've noticed is that when the color format is set to auto, it sometimes selects the full color range when it should be set to limited. This only happens with some devices, and you may need to be on the lookout to manually set the color format to full or limited to avoid greyish blacks. The power button and indicator are located on the side of the monitor, and the indicator is set to off by default (If I remember correctly). I think it would be more useful if it was set to on, so you could easily see if the monitor is powered on.\n\nThe integrated speakers are convenient, but don't have great sound quality as expected. The audio jack is weak, but useful to have. I can't speak to the Pentone validated colors, but out of the box I think this screen will be very appreciated for photo/video professionals who care about color accuracy, as long as 1080p is sufficient for their needs. The screen is very bright and should be usable outdoors. Overall, I would rate this lovely monitor an 8.5 out of 10, but it's really an 5-star amazon product.\n\nGreat screen, very good design, amazing screen for gaming and mobility, but limited to the native FHD resolution.\n\nI hope this review helps anyone considering purchasing this kind of portable OLED screen.\n\nSome info from the official specifications:\nLCD Type: LTPS TFT active matrix\nColor filter: RGB stripe\nGlass surface: Anti-glare (Haze 25%), Hard coating (3H)\nColor format: RGB (limited/full) YUV (limited/full)\nColor mode: DCI-P3, sRGB, REC709, DICOM-SIM, User\nView mode: CAD/CAM, Video Edit, Animation, Photo, FPS1, FPS2, RTS, Moba."

It's on par with the Samsung Tab OLEDs, which are my favourite screens in this size range. The brightness (and obviously, contrast) is amazing. I'm not sure why Amazon wants me to rate the touch screen, since there isn't one :)\n\nI have some design quibbles, though.\n\nThe bottom lip is really large, and the \"Viewsonic\" label on it is a bit obnoxiously prominent. The folding stand is pretty good; in my opinion, better than Asus ones, with the magnetic folding sleeve). However, I find the controls in the wrong place, since you can't access them, if you fold so that isn't elevated. Also, in portrait mode, you're pretty limited in the angles you can use it at.\n\nI do not like that you can't attach it to a stand/tripod (as presented) without using a supplied adapter nut that protrudes from the bottom. Also, there is no possibility for putting this on a VESA or other mount."

The colors are vibrant and accurate. The menu is easy to navigate. It’s super lightweight but also solid in build quality. It’s a 10/10. If viewsonic ever decides to make another one of these @ 120hz with gsync support, I will happily pick that one up too.\n\nRight now I’m using this for gaming for my desktop while I wait for new 240hz OLEDs to release next year. After that I’ll use it specifically for video color work. The color is accurate enough that I’d use it for professional work. It’s not as accurate as a professional color monitor but it’s also 320 dollars, not 10,000 dollars.\n\nI’d recommend this for anyone who is okay with 60hz. If you have a beefy graphics card, NVidia DSR looks phenomenal here and you’ll have a hard time distinguishing between this with DSR vs native 4k at this small of a size."

I have been disappointed in brightness and the \"set up.\" By that I mean a lot of the way the portable monitors stand up are flimsy and difficult to maneuver. The stand on this one is the bomb!!! The color and brightness on this is the bomb. I don't game, so I haven't really looked at refresh rates, since I primarily use this for work when I travel, or when I just want to sit out on the patio with 2 screens. I actually bought this one for my husband because the perfect monitor we purchased for him is just not bright enough. I will be replacing my current portable monitor with another one of these. There are only a couple of things that could be improved: 1) touchscreen - but I don't know if that is possible with oled 2) I could do without the \"hood\", so I actually just snipped that part off to make it only a magnetic cover for protection when traveling. Otherwise, it is a wonderful portable monitor."

NOTE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE THE RIGHT USB-C CABLE. This monitor was also able to power my Macs when connecting power to the monitor.\nThe HDMI port also works well. I was able to connect a Roku and watch TV.\nDislike:\nThe reason it got 4 stars rather than 5 is changing the volume requires diving into the menus. It's annoying, but considering the overall quality of the monitor, it's acceptable.\nIt would also be nice if the volume can be controlled through the HDMI interface. Then the Roku or FireStick interface would be able to change the volume.\n\nOverall, this is a good purchase and perfect for taking on the road with me."

The cables were all long enough to reach where I needed them, and I didn't have any issues plugging everything in.\n\nThis power supply is non-modular, which might be a downside for some people, but honestly, it didn't matter to me. The simple, straightforward design was just what I needed, and it saved me some cash compared to the fancier modular options out there. Another note is the colorful cables kinda stand out, but I don't care about the internal aesthetic of my PC.\n\nFor PSUs I'm all about sticking to trusted brands, and Thermaltake is good enough. It's a solid, no-frills power supply that does its job quietly and efficiently. If you're looking for a simple and reliable solution on a budget, I'd definitely recommend this over some no-name brand. It's a good pick for anyone who wants quality without breaking the bank."

The cables were all long enough to reach where I needed them, and I didn't have any issues plugging everything in.\n\nThis power supply is non-modular, which might be a downside for some people, but honestly, it didn't matter to me. The simple, straightforward design was just what I needed, and it saved me some cash compared to the fancier modular options out there. Another note is the colorful cables kinda stand out, but I don't care about the internal aesthetic of my PC.\n\nFor PSUs I'm all about sticking to trusted brands, and Thermaltake is good enough. It's a solid, no-frills power supply that does its job quietly and efficiently. If you're looking for a simple and reliable solution on a budget, I'd definitely recommend this over some no-name brand. It's a good pick for anyone who wants quality without breaking the bank."

I was skeptical but decided to take a chance given the very low price.\nPleased to see it had exactly the same 24 pin connector for the motherboard with all the same color (voltage) wires as the FSP from my Acer TC780. The 4 pin connector for the board was slightly confusing as it appeared to be an 8 pin connector instead. That may be the reason this is described as a 12 volt supply. Ignore that description. The 8 pin connector is actually TWO connectors side by side. I only needed half of that and they were easily separated and had the correct yellow and black wires. The other connectors for my two hard drives are standard.\nYes, the fan makes a little noise, but I had a Dell computer in the 90s that made 3 times as much noise.\nOverall, great value for the money and happy to have my computer running again."

        "review": "Needed something to revive an old Optiplex. Used Dell PSUs were more expensive whereas you could get this new for $20 with free Prime shipping. So of course I went with this.\n\nThere are things to like about it. Namely, it works. And that's about it.\n\nBut if you will, let me go off about this specific PSU.\n\nFor starters, it's crazy seeing through-hole components used throughout the PSU. Absolutely no SMDs. This is like an early 2000's design but being sold as completely new in the 2020's. I didn't go as deep but I have a feeling everything on the board was hand-soldered. Heck, you still need to select the input voltage on the back still. Pretty old-school.\nThe heatsinks for the MOSFETs might as well be stamped out of aluminum soda cans, that's how thin they are. I'm surprised they can dissipate heat well enough for this PSU's 400W rating, which leads me to my next point.\nThis PSU is rated for 400W of output, 300W of which is for the +12V rail. The sticker on the side of the PSU rates the input as 12A at 115V. What that means is at full tilt, the PSU needs 1380W! That's absolutely insane! While I dare not want to find out if that's true, I have a feeling the paltry heatsinks I mentioned would probably be melting at that point, even with the 80 mm fan in the PSU. Speaking of which...\nOn the box, the fan is mentioned as a \"80mm silent design\" which is honestly laughable. The fan itself has no label or identification marks at all, and the quality of it sets the lowest bar of what could be considered a \"fan\". It operates at only a single speed: loud. But it definitely needs a fan because, well...\nThe efficiency is pretty low. While not a scientific test, I compared this PSU to another PSU with a known efficiency curve and placed it in an identical system. From my own calculations, this PSU struggles to hit 75% efficiency and it only drops from there (hopefully not to the 29% you can calculate from above). You can tell this PSU gets warm after decent use.\nThe wires are unsubstantial and thin, but they do connect things. Makes it pretty easy to cable manage actually so that's a small plus.\nFinally, the casing. I think those metal tin cans that grandma's cookies come in are thicker than what encloses all these angry pixies. No, scratch that, these are sad pixies because I know I'd be one if I had the misfortune of being routed through this box.\n\nBut as much as I rag on this PSU, for $20, it does the job. And if you find yourself needing a new PSU but want to put the least amount of investment into it, well, here you go.\n\n4 stars."

I found that the PSU case was very light weight and fit properly in the space available. The wires were long enough to to fit everywhere I needed them. I have a SATA DVD drive, IDE CD rom drive, SATA SSD, SATA HDD and a legacy IDE HDD, a SATA SD Card reader module, along with several cooling fans. I was able to connect everything to the power supply properly. Some reviewers stated there were not enough plugs, or the wires were not long enough, and that the SATA power plugs did not fit. I did not have any problems at all with my plugs fitting. I can't vouch for the longevity of this unit yet, but at this point I would recommend this as a value replacement for an older PC you are not ready to replace yet."

        "review": "The fan on my old HP P7-1110 started making a very loud noise so I needed to replace the power supply. I chose to do this rather than just replace the fan out of ease of repair. I searched a lot on-line and had a lot of trouble trying to find something that I felt would fit the old unit. This Coolmax description said it was kind of universal, so for 20 bucks I figured I would give it a try. There were both very positive and very negative reviews so I was not sure what to expect.\nAs far as Amazon, somehow they managed to get it to me in a day, even though they are way backed up with holiday shopping, so thank you Amazon for great service.\nAfter opening the box the power supply came in, I was a bit surprised to find no written instructions or any documentation at all. There was the power supply and a power cord; that's it.\nI removed the old power supply from the computer casing but left all the wiring attached to it. Then I put the new unit in to see how it would fit. It was just about a perfect fit, except the A/C cord is in a different location, which was partially blocked by a piece of metal on the PC casing. I used a rotary tool to remove a bit of the metal that was in the way and then the new power supply fit with no issues.\nAfter screwing it in place, I removed the wiring from the old power supply to the mother board, and replaced them with the wiring from the new power supply. I only had a total of 3 connections I needed to move so not too bad.\nI plugged the computer in and the thing powered up no problem. So I unplugged it, zip ties the wires and replaced the cover to the computer. After setting it up again with the monitor, keyboard, etc., I started the computer up and it all worked fine.\nThe only issue I am not totally satisfied with is the noise of the fan. It seems to be blowing a lot more than the old unit. Of course, this is a 500 watt, replacing a 250 watt power supply. I simply couldn't find an exact replacement, as the computer is probably around 8 years old.\nOther than the noise from the fan, so far everything is working fine. For the price I paid, I guess I should not complain. However, I did want to point it out so if someone is ordering this unit, they would know what to expect."

        "review": "Needed a new PSU for a PC I was refurbing in order to work with the GPU that was to go in it.\nNormally I'd opt for something with at least an 80+ Bronze rating, but one from a reputable brand can be kinda expensive, so instead based on my, and others, experiences with EVGA, I opted for this budget option.\n\nAt first glance it looked decent build quality, felt fairly solidly built in hand but still a bit cheap. Everything even checked out fine when testing with my 24-pin PSU jumper, fan spun up which normally means it's all good.\nGot everything installed inside the 2010 HP Pavilion Elite's awful mini-ATX case, and did the best cable management I could, despite it being cramped and having nowhere to hide the cables.\nMade sure it was plugged into the outlet, flipped on the PSU, pressed the power switch and... Nothing. Tried reseating all the cables, still nothing.\nI knew it couldn't be the components here, since from prior testing they were still working fine and 550W should've been more than enough for a Phenom II 1090T and R9 280X powered PC.\n\nAs a last ditch attempt, I thought since I used only one of the SATA power cables for both the SSD and Blu-ray drive as is normal, maybe I could try using both of the included cables, one for each drive.\nSurprisingly, that actually fixed it and now it's working perfectly fine. Still not looking good for the PSU though, as any decent quality PSU should be able to handle at least a few daisy chained SATA peripherals, but it looks like this one can't.\nAt least now that it's working, I can say it does handle the overall system perfectly fine, while also running both very cool and quiet under load.\n\nAs much as I'm willing to endorse EVGA's more mainstream products though, I'm afraid I just can't really recommend this one. It's not bad, but it's still not good either. It's just okay."

        "review": "I don't really have PSU testing tools, so I defer any serious considerations to them, but this model does have a lot of shining reviews by those who do have the tools (though of course reviews have to always be taken with a grain of salt. Or a whole shaker even these days.)\n\nWhat I can tell is that it has all the outward signs of a quality PSU. It's quite hefty for its size, seems to have a good fan, etc etc. When I measure things like voltage via software (not sure how reliable that is, but it's the best I have,) they seem to be more stable than my previous PSUs.\n\nOne curiosity I don't really know how to explain is it has an extra relay inside doing who knows what. When you first turn things on, it's already able to handle the full power draw of the computer, so it's not like it's a low power switch for suspending or something -- it's straight to 100% before the relay even switches. I'm wondering if it switches on a capacitor after initial startup pull to handle power blinks and the like while avoiding that huge sudden instant draw you'd normally get, but this is merely a guess.\n\nAll in all I'm very much liking it. It's a tiny bit more compact to also work with smaller systems, but also fits fine in my mid tower (these days I guess that's considered a full tower, lol.) The modular cables work fairly well, though I wish the parts that can be put together or pulled apart (like the CPU power connector) snapped together more firmly so you don't have to carefully hold them together while inserting. I was pleasantly surprised it even included the latest 12VHPWR type-4 connector.\n\nI guess if I had to try to choose something to complain about, I wish the power efficiency curve was a bit friendlier towards the low end. Most people aren't actually using anywhere near to 850 watts of power (a lot of people would be very shocked if they plugged their computers into a Kill-a-Watt or similar meter!) For most people normal usage and light gaming is easily going to fall into the bottom side of the curve and get somewhere in the vicinity of 75% efficiency. Ideally one would pick a PSU that more aligns with what the system actually uses (taking care to ensure sufficient current of course) but I can say I picked this one because I needed a PSU I could keep for many years to come and pretty much not even have to think about it no matter what I added to my system (within reason of course. I'm not likely to be adding any of the highest end CPUs or GPUs and especially not dual GPUs which is where one is most likely to start to actually get up to numbers closer to 850.)\n\nI think most people will never come even close to fully utilizing this PSU making it a great option for a huge variety of systems (albeit at the cost of some efficiency loss for most.) From what I can tell I think we can count on it to hold up over time. Even the fan should be decent enough to not die too easily. Especially since most of the time on systems that aren't pushing it really hard the fan runs extremely quietly at a lower RPM."

        "review": "Overall, the Corsair RM1000x is a decent power supply unit (PSU) that comes at a relatively good price, especially if you can find it on sale. The sleek design and quiet fan operation are pluses, and the thick, durable cables indicate good build quality. However, there are a few drawbacks to consider.\n\nEase of installation may be a challenge, particularly if you have a smaller case. The cables are stiff and not flat, which can make cable management difficult, and they may not fit through smaller case holes or leave enough clearance to put the back panel back on. However, the cables are wrapped in mesh to help protect them, and once you get them plugged in, they are unlikely to break.\n\nSpeaking of the cables, the marketing images are misleading when it comes to the number of PCIe cables that come with the unit. Corsair should update the product descriptions to match the actual number of cables. The RM1000x comes with 3 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins for a total of 6 8 pin PCIe connections (Though for the newer GPUs it is advised to not use the additional 8 pin), And the RM850x comes with 2 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins as well for a total of 4 8 pin connections.\n\nIn terms of price, the RM1000x is a good value, especially if you can find it on sale. At the time of purchase, it was the cheapest name-brand 80+ Gold rated PSU available. Additionally, the warranty period is very decent, which adds to the overall value.\n\nIn conclusion, the Corsair RM1000x is a solid PSU with a few drawbacks to consider. If you have a larger case and don't mind dealing with stiff cables, this PSU is a good option. The build quality is high, and the price is reasonable, especially when on sale."

        "review": "This is a great quality product from well-known reputable company, a PSU with great modularity and great performance, and frankly a good value. Lots of connectors and on the shift model, if that's what you're looking at side mounted connection points.\n\nHere's where the details come in. Is this PSU is primarily for cases with side mounted PSU slots, while in a wider case this might work in a flat mount situation, most likely you are going to need a fairly wide case to house the wiring coming off the supply without bending the wires too much. Even then in some side mount cases, or the PSU is mounted on its side, the wires sticking upright can still impede on certain things, for example with the Lian-Li o11 dynamic XL, The upright facing ports for the connectors on the wires to plug into impede with the bottom hot swap hard drive bay. Now if I really wanted to press the wires down flat against the power supply unit I could probably still fit the hot swap bay in the case, but it wouldn't give much room for the wires, nor allow for much passive heat dissipation from the PSU. In this particular instance with the case I chose a standard end connector output PSU would have been the better choice, as there is ample room at the end for wiring clutter, but due to the hot swap bay mounted above the power supply unit, the side output of the shift model is not intuitive for my case.\n\nRemoval of the bottom hot swap bay in my case alleviated the issue, but also presents the inconvenience of not having all four hot swap bays available. I never thought I would use this feature, but over the years as I have acquired multiple hard drives and stored up massive amounts of data, it actually comes in handy for moving data back and forth between drives.\n\nSo no stars docked for the design it's actually great, just really think about whether or not you need the side output connectors and whether or not you will have enough room in your case. They make it more convenient to plug and unplug additional wires without having to remove the power supply unit completely, however you may run into spacing issues in smaller cases.\n\nSituationally recommended."

        "review": "I recently purchased the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply, and I must say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and features. Corsair has always been known for delivering high-quality power supplies, and the RM850x is no exception. Here's my review of this remarkable power supply.\n\nFirst and foremost, the efficiency of the RM850x is outstanding. With its 80 PLUS Gold certification, it delivers excellent power efficiency, ensuring that my system consumes less energy and runs cooler. This not only helps in reducing electricity bills but also contributes to the overall longevity and reliability of my system.\n\nThe fully modular design of the RM850x is a game-changer. It allows for easy cable management, as I can connect only the cables I need and keep the rest neatly stored away. This not only enhances the aesthetics of my build but also improves airflow within the case. The modular design also makes installation a breeze, as I can effortlessly connect the required cables without any clutter or hassle.\n\nOne of the standout features of this power supply is its low-noise fan. The fan operates silently under regular loads, and I barely notice its presence. It only kicks in when the system is under heavy load, and even then, the noise levels are impressively low. The Zero RPM fan mode is particularly noteworthy, as it ensures complete silence during idle or low-power usage scenarios. This is a great feature for those who prefer a quiet computing experience.\n\nThe build quality of the RM850x is top-notch. The unit feels solid and durable, and the black finish gives it a sleek and premium look. The cables provided are of high quality and have a premium feel as well. The power supply comes with all the necessary protections, including over-voltage, under-voltage, over-power, over-temperature, and short-circuit protection, ensuring the safety of my components.\n\nIn terms of power delivery, the RM850x handles my system with ease. It provides ample power for my high-end components, including a demanding CPU and a high-performance graphics card. The voltage regulation is excellent, and I have not encountered any stability issues or power-related problems since installing this power supply.\n\nOne minor drawback of the RM850x is its size. It's a bit larger than some other power supplies on the market, so it might not fit into smaller PC cases. However, in most standard ATX cases, this should not be an issue.\n\nOverall, the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply is an exceptional product that delivers on all fronts. Its efficiency, modular design, low-noise fan, and solid build quality make it a reliable choice for any PC enthusiast or gamer. With its impressive performance and thoughtful features, the RM850x is definitely worth the investment for those looking for a high-quality power supply to power their systems.\n\nI highly recommend the Corsair RM850x to anyone in need of a powerful, efficient, and silent power supply for their PC build. Corsair has once again raised the bar with this outstanding product."

        "review": "Got this PSU cause I knew it 1. had more than enough power needed for my new build and 2. the case it went into was designed by corsair, and was able to check clearance on everything. I didn't go with the Shift version of the PSU for the simple reason that although it's unique, I see a lot of people complaining about its practicality. So, I went with the 2021 version of the RM1000x.\n\nThe pros are basic. Strong but also stiff cables with protection in the proper places. Very easy overall install & modularity we've came to be familiar with when it comes to modern PSU's. Quiet operation, & plenty of peace of mind knowing I have plenty of power for my build (6950xt + 13600k).\n\nCONS.... This is the biggest con thus far, and I will complain about it until the end of time. Not that it's ever been okay practice, but having your PCIE cables all have a pigtailed additional 6 pin is just miserable to deal with. My GPU requires two 8 pins & one 6 pin... that's three separate cables with three separate & dangling 6 pin pigtails that'll never be used. I can understand giving only 6+2's even though it should be practice at this point to have some full 8 pin's, but I'll never understand a 6+2's with pigtailed 6 pins on a 1000W unit..... JUST NO. Please, if you're reading this and considering this PSU, please keep in mind to use a separate PCIE 6+2 cable for each connection on the card, AND DO NOT USE THE PIGTAILED 6 PIN THAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM. For lower power cards back in the day this wasn't a huge deal but was still bad practice to daisy chain your PCIE connections like that. Nowadays, with the power these cards are capable of drawing, there's NO REASON a 1000w PSU would even give you the option to daisy chain. A pretty big & detrimental (in my opinion) overlook on Corsair's part. Luckily you can use a cable tie or strap & just bunch them all together but... no one that has built a pc will tell you it looks good.\n\nother than that one major annoyance that I deem to be a con, great power supply."

        "review": "While this looked really cool and I thought it would be a game changer, I would HIGHLY recommend anyone to really check against the case you plan to use and the internal configuration, ie. where the PSU will be mounted.\n\nI used this with a Corsair 7000D, so there was a very good chance it would be compatible. While the idea of easier access of cabling via side mounting to the PSU, the thing I realized is that not all cases are aligned to this orientation. Most cases today assume rear mounted cables. This means that they don't always have enough clearance between the PSU and the side panel to accommodate the cables. Given I had a Corsair case, it wasn't a problem. The motherboard cable did seem to be a tight fit but made it work. With this PSU, I do believe it allowed me to keep the 2nd 3.5\" drive cage closest to the PSU. If I had used traditional rear mounted cable PSU, I definitely would need to sacrifice this drive cage. It wouldn't be a huge deal breaker as I, like most people, are moving away from HDD to SSD.\n\nIt worked out for me. Was it mind blowing amazing or evolutionary? I don't think so... I don't think it will be until case manufacturers start considering this PSU into their designs. For now, it's best compatible with Corsair cases. For other brands, really think through whether you'll have the clearances you need. Otherwise, stick to traditional rear cable mounted PSUs.\n\nThe other reason why I got this particular PSU was because it was the only Corsair one that was ATX3.0 at the 1000W+ range. Needed ATX3.0 to ensure I had the native 12pin power cable for the RTX 4090 to minimize using the octopus adapter that is provide by the card for older PSU. This adapter could increase the chance of the \"melting cable\" situation for NVidia cards. Native 12pin GPU cable is the way to go. It also keeps things clean and minimized."

More people have been and continue to check out their entire line of products, as this brand has been gaining more and more attention over the years. I highly recommend not just this power supply unit, but any of their offerings due to price & performance. When it comes to a power supply you I would never cheap out and I've always recommended and purchased ONLY solid, well known and thoroughly researched power supply units.\n\nWith that said, however, I've watched this company rise from nothing & can say for certainty that I have no worry or fear that this will short out or mess up my $3000+ dollar pc gaming build. It provides solid & consistent power, plenty of it too, to all of my internal components. The RGB lighting looks stellar, and is a nice bonus to top it all off."

Connected to Gigabyte Aorus Elite AX motherboard with an Intel i7-13900K CPU and Cooler Master CPU cooler. Everything works as expected.\nPSU has nice RGB color lighting on the fan but you cannot connect it to the motherboard for full synchronization to all RGB lighting.

Since my system is older, the older molex connectors came in handy to power the RGB Fans. That was a nice touch. This system is not a power house, but it will allow me to upgrade my graphics card with an 8 pin power card. Plenty of power to run my system as it is. Probably last another 5 years which is fine by me.\n\nHere's the story: 2 weeks ago we had a pretty bad storm and I heard thunder and lightning all night. The next day I was using my desktop computer and all of the sudden it shut itself off. I had to reset the power supply switch before the computer would turn back on. The computer booted and I resumed working. The same thing happened for the next 2 weeks, at least every day or two. Then yesterday I went to start it and the computer wouldn't even power on. I suspected the power supply was the issue. Since replacing it's all back to good, so far! :D"

The cables were all long enough to reach where I needed them, and I didn't have any issues plugging everything in.\n\nThis power supply is non-modular, which might be a downside for some people, but honestly, it didn't matter to me. The simple, straightforward design was just what I needed, and it saved me some cash compared to the fancier modular options out there. Another note is the colorful cables kinda stand out, but I don't care about the internal aesthetic of my PC.\n\nFor PSUs I'm all about sticking to trusted brands, and Thermaltake is good enough. It's a solid, no-frills power supply that does its job quietly and efficiently. If you're looking for a simple and reliable solution on a budget, I'd definitely recommend this over some no-name brand. It's a good pick for anyone who wants quality without breaking the bank."

Sadly I got this to replace the one in my old DELL PowerEdge SC420 server, but the placement of the plug housing was just stuck out a little making it not fit without modifying the case a little. So I just put it in this DELL Optiplex GX620 and now I can use that video card I bought not knowing it required 500 watts to run properly. Lucky for me :).\nThis unit comes with +4 power for Pentium 4 boards, molax and sata power also FDD. Notice that the picture shows the cooling fan which means that it is upside down making the power plug on the left side not the right when installed. Runs very quiet. If you have an open back plate for PS this is a good choice for the 500 watt range."

The quick and dirty is that this lacks some very basic considerations that make me concerned of its quality. The cables are very cheap feeling, the gage of the wiring seems very thin and the coating feels like plastic. The PCIe cables are red, ruining the otherwise clean black cable look. The packaging is over done in its presentation trying to look like a higher end product and does achieve it, but never have I ever bought a power supply, cheap or expensive, some that did not even have a box, just vacuum sealed bag BUT ALL HAD A POWER CORD!!! HOW CAN YOU SELL A POWER SUPPLY WITH NO POWER CORD????\n\nand last but not least is that they were not even smart enough to place there logo/specs so they could be viewed properly, it will be upside down in any configuration except for if you install in the bottom of case exhausting into your case??? It must be an oversight?\n\nI'm really not feeling good about the rated quality of the PSU. I can't use this for the intended build because of the upside down logo but I will test the product soon and add to this review, in the near future\n\nEdit: I did test this PSU, it did produce solid voltages in bios and in hwinfo. Under heavy loads or gaming, it maintained solid power. I did have left a pic of the build, the upside down logo will always bother me! But all in all for 57 dollars I payed, was a good deal. At its present price point, I would keep looking\n\nFinal edit, this PSU died after about 12 months"

        "review": "Overall, the Corsair RM1000x is a decent power supply unit (PSU) that comes at a relatively good price, especially if you can find it on sale. The sleek design and quiet fan operation are pluses, and the thick, durable cables indicate good build quality. However, there are a few drawbacks to consider.\n\nEase of installation may be a challenge, particularly if you have a smaller case. The cables are stiff and not flat, which can make cable management difficult, and they may not fit through smaller case holes or leave enough clearance to put the back panel back on. However, the cables are wrapped in mesh to help protect them, and once you get them plugged in, they are unlikely to break.\n\nSpeaking of the cables, the marketing images are misleading when it comes to the number of PCIe cables that come with the unit. Corsair should update the product descriptions to match the actual number of cables. The RM1000x comes with 3 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins for a total of 6 8 pin PCIe connections (Though for the newer GPUs it is advised to not use the additional 8 pin), And the RM850x comes with 2 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins as well for a total of 4 8 pin connections.\n\nIn terms of price, the RM1000x is a good value, especially if you can find it on sale. At the time of purchase, it was the cheapest name-brand 80+ Gold rated PSU available. Additionally, the warranty period is very decent, which adds to the overall value.\n\nIn conclusion, the Corsair RM1000x is a solid PSU with a few drawbacks to consider. If you have a larger case and don't mind dealing with stiff cables, this PSU is a good option. The build quality is high, and the price is reasonable, especially when on sale."

        "review": "This is a great quality product from well-known reputable company, a PSU with great modularity and great performance, and frankly a good value. Lots of connectors and on the shift model, if that's what you're looking at side mounted connection points.\n\nHere's where the details come in. Is this PSU is primarily for cases with side mounted PSU slots, while in a wider case this might work in a flat mount situation, most likely you are going to need a fairly wide case to house the wiring coming off the supply without bending the wires too much. Even then in some side mount cases, or the PSU is mounted on its side, the wires sticking upright can still impede on certain things, for example with the Lian-Li o11 dynamic XL, The upright facing ports for the connectors on the wires to plug into impede with the bottom hot swap hard drive bay. Now if I really wanted to press the wires down flat against the power supply unit I could probably still fit the hot swap bay in the case, but it wouldn't give much room for the wires, nor allow for much passive heat dissipation from the PSU. In this particular instance with the case I chose a standard end connector output PSU would have been the better choice, as there is ample room at the end for wiring clutter, but due to the hot swap bay mounted above the power supply unit, the side output of the shift model is not intuitive for my case.\n\nRemoval of the bottom hot swap bay in my case alleviated the issue, but also presents the inconvenience of not having all four hot swap bays available. I never thought I would use this feature, but over the years as I have acquired multiple hard drives and stored up massive amounts of data, it actually comes in handy for moving data back and forth between drives.\n\nSo no stars docked for the design it's actually great, just really think about whether or not you need the side output connectors and whether or not you will have enough room in your case. They make it more convenient to plug and unplug additional wires without having to remove the power supply unit completely, however you may run into spacing issues in smaller cases.\n\nSituationally recommended."

        "review": "I recently purchased the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply, and I must say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and features. Corsair has always been known for delivering high-quality power supplies, and the RM850x is no exception. Here's my review of this remarkable power supply.\n\nFirst and foremost, the efficiency of the RM850x is outstanding. With its 80 PLUS Gold certification, it delivers excellent power efficiency, ensuring that my system consumes less energy and runs cooler. This not only helps in reducing electricity bills but also contributes to the overall longevity and reliability of my system.\n\nThe fully modular design of the RM850x is a game-changer. It allows for easy cable management, as I can connect only the cables I need and keep the rest neatly stored away. This not only enhances the aesthetics of my build but also improves airflow within the case. The modular design also makes installation a breeze, as I can effortlessly connect the required cables without any clutter or hassle.\n\nOne of the standout features of this power supply is its low-noise fan. The fan operates silently under regular loads, and I barely notice its presence. It only kicks in when the system is under heavy load, and even then, the noise levels are impressively low. The Zero RPM fan mode is particularly noteworthy, as it ensures complete silence during idle or low-power usage scenarios. This is a great feature for those who prefer a quiet computing experience.\n\nThe build quality of the RM850x is top-notch. The unit feels solid and durable, and the black finish gives it a sleek and premium look. The cables provided are of high quality and have a premium feel as well. The power supply comes with all the necessary protections, including over-voltage, under-voltage, over-power, over-temperature, and short-circuit protection, ensuring the safety of my components.\n\nIn terms of power delivery, the RM850x handles my system with ease. It provides ample power for my high-end components, including a demanding CPU and a high-performance graphics card. The voltage regulation is excellent, and I have not encountered any stability issues or power-related problems since installing this power supply.\n\nOne minor drawback of the RM850x is its size. It's a bit larger than some other power supplies on the market, so it might not fit into smaller PC cases. However, in most standard ATX cases, this should not be an issue.\n\nOverall, the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply is an exceptional product that delivers on all fronts. Its efficiency, modular design, low-noise fan, and solid build quality make it a reliable choice for any PC enthusiast or gamer. With its impressive performance and thoughtful features, the RM850x is definitely worth the investment for those looking for a high-quality power supply to power their systems.\n\nI highly recommend the Corsair RM850x to anyone in need of a powerful, efficient, and silent power supply for their PC build. Corsair has once again raised the bar with this outstanding product."

        "review": "Got this PSU cause I knew it 1. had more than enough power needed for my new build and 2. the case it went into was designed by corsair, and was able to check clearance on everything. I didn't go with the Shift version of the PSU for the simple reason that although it's unique, I see a lot of people complaining about its practicality. So, I went with the 2021 version of the RM1000x.\n\nThe pros are basic. Strong but also stiff cables with protection in the proper places. Very easy overall install & modularity we've came to be familiar with when it comes to modern PSU's. Quiet operation, & plenty of peace of mind knowing I have plenty of power for my build (6950xt + 13600k).\n\nCONS.... This is the biggest con thus far, and I will complain about it until the end of time. Not that it's ever been okay practice, but having your PCIE cables all have a pigtailed additional 6 pin is just miserable to deal with. My GPU requires two 8 pins & one 6 pin... that's three separate cables with three separate & dangling 6 pin pigtails that'll never be used. I can understand giving only 6+2's even though it should be practice at this point to have some full 8 pin's, but I'll never understand a 6+2's with pigtailed 6 pins on a 1000W unit..... JUST NO. Please, if you're reading this and considering this PSU, please keep in mind to use a separate PCIE 6+2 cable for each connection on the card, AND DO NOT USE THE PIGTAILED 6 PIN THAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM. For lower power cards back in the day this wasn't a huge deal but was still bad practice to daisy chain your PCIE connections like that. Nowadays, with the power these cards are capable of drawing, there's NO REASON a 1000w PSU would even give you the option to daisy chain. A pretty big & detrimental (in my opinion) overlook on Corsair's part. Luckily you can use a cable tie or strap & just bunch them all together but... no one that has built a pc will tell you it looks good.\n\nother than that one major annoyance that I deem to be a con, great power supply."

        "review": "While this looked really cool and I thought it would be a game changer, I would HIGHLY recommend anyone to really check against the case you plan to use and the internal configuration, ie. where the PSU will be mounted.\n\nI used this with a Corsair 7000D, so there was a very good chance it would be compatible. While the idea of easier access of cabling via side mounting to the PSU, the thing I realized is that not all cases are aligned to this orientation. Most cases today assume rear mounted cables. This means that they don't always have enough clearance between the PSU and the side panel to accommodate the cables. Given I had a Corsair case, it wasn't a problem. The motherboard cable did seem to be a tight fit but made it work. With this PSU, I do believe it allowed me to keep the 2nd 3.5\" drive cage closest to the PSU. If I had used traditional rear mounted cable PSU, I definitely would need to sacrifice this drive cage. It wouldn't be a huge deal breaker as I, like most people, are moving away from HDD to SSD.\n\nIt worked out for me. Was it mind blowing amazing or evolutionary? I don't think so... I don't think it will be until case manufacturers start considering this PSU into their designs. For now, it's best compatible with Corsair cases. For other brands, really think through whether you'll have the clearances you need. Otherwise, stick to traditional rear cable mounted PSUs.\n\nThe other reason why I got this particular PSU was because it was the only Corsair one that was ATX3.0 at the 1000W+ range. Needed ATX3.0 to ensure I had the native 12pin power cable for the RTX 4090 to minimize using the octopus adapter that is provide by the card for older PSU. This adapter could increase the chance of the \"melting cable\" situation for NVidia cards. Native 12pin GPU cable is the way to go. It also keeps things clean and minimized."

        "review": "Overall, the Corsair RM1000x is a decent power supply unit (PSU) that comes at a relatively good price, especially if you can find it on sale. The sleek design and quiet fan operation are pluses, and the thick, durable cables indicate good build quality. However, there are a few drawbacks to consider.\n\nEase of installation may be a challenge, particularly if you have a smaller case. The cables are stiff and not flat, which can make cable management difficult, and they may not fit through smaller case holes or leave enough clearance to put the back panel back on. However, the cables are wrapped in mesh to help protect them, and once you get them plugged in, they are unlikely to break.\n\nSpeaking of the cables, the marketing images are misleading when it comes to the number of PCIe cables that come with the unit. Corsair should update the product descriptions to match the actual number of cables. The RM1000x comes with 3 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins for a total of 6 8 pin PCIe connections (Though for the newer GPUs it is advised to not use the additional 8 pin), And the RM850x comes with 2 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins as well for a total of 4 8 pin connections.\n\nIn terms of price, the RM1000x is a good value, especially if you can find it on sale. At the time of purchase, it was the cheapest name-brand 80+ Gold rated PSU available. Additionally, the warranty period is very decent, which adds to the overall value.\n\nIn conclusion, the Corsair RM1000x is a solid PSU with a few drawbacks to consider. If you have a larger case and don't mind dealing with stiff cables, this PSU is a good option. The build quality is high, and the price is reasonable, especially when on sale."

        "review": "This is a great quality product from well-known reputable company, a PSU with great modularity and great performance, and frankly a good value. Lots of connectors and on the shift model, if that's what you're looking at side mounted connection points.\n\nHere's where the details come in. Is this PSU is primarily for cases with side mounted PSU slots, while in a wider case this might work in a flat mount situation, most likely you are going to need a fairly wide case to house the wiring coming off the supply without bending the wires too much. Even then in some side mount cases, or the PSU is mounted on its side, the wires sticking upright can still impede on certain things, for example with the Lian-Li o11 dynamic XL, The upright facing ports for the connectors on the wires to plug into impede with the bottom hot swap hard drive bay. Now if I really wanted to press the wires down flat against the power supply unit I could probably still fit the hot swap bay in the case, but it wouldn't give much room for the wires, nor allow for much passive heat dissipation from the PSU. In this particular instance with the case I chose a standard end connector output PSU would have been the better choice, as there is ample room at the end for wiring clutter, but due to the hot swap bay mounted above the power supply unit, the side output of the shift model is not intuitive for my case.\n\nRemoval of the bottom hot swap bay in my case alleviated the issue, but also presents the inconvenience of not having all four hot swap bays available. I never thought I would use this feature, but over the years as I have acquired multiple hard drives and stored up massive amounts of data, it actually comes in handy for moving data back and forth between drives.\n\nSo no stars docked for the design it's actually great, just really think about whether or not you need the side output connectors and whether or not you will have enough room in your case. They make it more convenient to plug and unplug additional wires without having to remove the power supply unit completely, however you may run into spacing issues in smaller cases.\n\nSituationally recommended."

        "review": "I recently purchased the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply, and I must say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and features. Corsair has always been known for delivering high-quality power supplies, and the RM850x is no exception. Here's my review of this remarkable power supply.\n\nFirst and foremost, the efficiency of the RM850x is outstanding. With its 80 PLUS Gold certification, it delivers excellent power efficiency, ensuring that my system consumes less energy and runs cooler. This not only helps in reducing electricity bills but also contributes to the overall longevity and reliability of my system.\n\nThe fully modular design of the RM850x is a game-changer. It allows for easy cable management, as I can connect only the cables I need and keep the rest neatly stored away. This not only enhances the aesthetics of my build but also improves airflow within the case. The modular design also makes installation a breeze, as I can effortlessly connect the required cables without any clutter or hassle.\n\nOne of the standout features of this power supply is its low-noise fan. The fan operates silently under regular loads, and I barely notice its presence. It only kicks in when the system is under heavy load, and even then, the noise levels are impressively low. The Zero RPM fan mode is particularly noteworthy, as it ensures complete silence during idle or low-power usage scenarios. This is a great feature for those who prefer a quiet computing experience.\n\nThe build quality of the RM850x is top-notch. The unit feels solid and durable, and the black finish gives it a sleek and premium look. The cables provided are of high quality and have a premium feel as well. The power supply comes with all the necessary protections, including over-voltage, under-voltage, over-power, over-temperature, and short-circuit protection, ensuring the safety of my components.\n\nIn terms of power delivery, the RM850x handles my system with ease. It provides ample power for my high-end components, including a demanding CPU and a high-performance graphics card. The voltage regulation is excellent, and I have not encountered any stability issues or power-related problems since installing this power supply.\n\nOne minor drawback of the RM850x is its size. It's a bit larger than some other power supplies on the market, so it might not fit into smaller PC cases. However, in most standard ATX cases, this should not be an issue.\n\nOverall, the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply is an exceptional product that delivers on all fronts. Its efficiency, modular design, low-noise fan, and solid build quality make it a reliable choice for any PC enthusiast or gamer. With its impressive performance and thoughtful features, the RM850x is definitely worth the investment for those looking for a high-quality power supply to power their systems.\n\nI highly recommend the Corsair RM850x to anyone in need of a powerful, efficient, and silent power supply for their PC build. Corsair has once again raised the bar with this outstanding product."

        "review": "Got this PSU cause I knew it 1. had more than enough power needed for my new build and 2. the case it went into was designed by corsair, and was able to check clearance on everything. I didn't go with the Shift version of the PSU for the simple reason that although it's unique, I see a lot of people complaining about its practicality. So, I went with the 2021 version of the RM1000x.\n\nThe pros are basic. Strong but also stiff cables with protection in the proper places. Very easy overall install & modularity we've came to be familiar with when it comes to modern PSU's. Quiet operation, & plenty of peace of mind knowing I have plenty of power for my build (6950xt + 13600k).\n\nCONS.... This is the biggest con thus far, and I will complain about it until the end of time. Not that it's ever been okay practice, but having your PCIE cables all have a pigtailed additional 6 pin is just miserable to deal with. My GPU requires two 8 pins & one 6 pin... that's three separate cables with three separate & dangling 6 pin pigtails that'll never be used. I can understand giving only 6+2's even though it should be practice at this point to have some full 8 pin's, but I'll never understand a 6+2's with pigtailed 6 pins on a 1000W unit..... JUST NO. Please, if you're reading this and considering this PSU, please keep in mind to use a separate PCIE 6+2 cable for each connection on the card, AND DO NOT USE THE PIGTAILED 6 PIN THAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM. For lower power cards back in the day this wasn't a huge deal but was still bad practice to daisy chain your PCIE connections like that. Nowadays, with the power these cards are capable of drawing, there's NO REASON a 1000w PSU would even give you the option to daisy chain. A pretty big & detrimental (in my opinion) overlook on Corsair's part. Luckily you can use a cable tie or strap & just bunch them all together but... no one that has built a pc will tell you it looks good.\n\nother than that one major annoyance that I deem to be a con, great power supply."

Honestly I thought this thing would cause issues out of the gate, but I was pleasantly surprised when everything went very smooth and I had only 1 issue. There was only a single 8 PIN header for cpu socket power, this was easy enough to resolve by purchasing an adapter cable for about 5 bucks. Most PSUs today have at least 2 of those headers, and if they dont they will come with an adapter which i had to buy.... But for the money i dont think you will find a better deal around... One thing i can't speak to yet is LONGEVITY. PSUs in this price range / quality level tend to age like fine milk and expire much more quickly than their more well built, much more expensive counterparts. Time will tell that tale and if it's still going strong here in a year or two i will def change this review to reflect that with a full 5 stars... FINGERS CROSSED!!"

One thing of note: there is only one 6+2 cable, which is appropriate for a 550W PSU, but if you have a GPU with more than one 8-pin connector, this is not the PSU for you. That said, it is a good value that does what it is supposed to do. We'll see how they hold up long-term."

Inside the box were 110 AC cable, the PSU, a bag with 4 screws for mounting the unit and some documentation. The bundled cables are all black but are not sleeved or in my opinion properly bundled presenting as a loose grouping of individual wires with only 2 zip ties installed to group each cable bundle . I placed a 4\" zip tie every 3\" to each cable bundle to prevent a rats nest of all the loose wires going every where within the build. It looks much neater now even in a case with minimal cable management capability such as the one I am using for this project, a Rosewill FBM-01 mini tower. I am still waiting for a FM2+ MoBo to arrive to finish putting together the project.\n\nI did, however, pretest this PSU with a power supply tester and all the output lines are working properly. I'll supply more info when the build is complete and fully burned in. For now everything seems OK so it looks like I won't have to send this PSU back to Amazon based on my preliminary testing.\n\nHere's the tester I use to pre-check PSU's I bought this after installing a dead PSU better a pre check than a disassembly.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Computer-PC-Tester-Connectors-Enclosure/dp/B076CLNPPK/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2T0Q4ADFHBPOM&dchild=1&keywords=power+supply+tester+for+atx%2Fsata%2Fhdd&qid=1597075680&sprefix=power+supply+test%2Caps%2C228&sr=8-4\n\nEDIT\n\nGot a FM-2 Mo-Bo and installed a A10-5700 APU and a Asus 750-TI with a 8GB set of Ram a 128GB TeamGroup SSD boot drive and a 500 GB Seagate data HDD. I also included a DVD burner as I have a stack of them to get rid of. I placed all of that in a Rosewill FBM-01 case, a little tight wo/ great cable management space but OK. The system has been running great since it was built on August 18th. As we have no issues for a full month from the build generally and specifically the Captain 550 PSU I am happy with the power supply performance thus far. If any issues arise in the future, although unexpected in this undemanding build, I will revisit my review.\n\n2nd edit. It's the end of October and the unit is still running just fine. No BSD's of shutoffs or any other janky behaviors. For my use as a secondary computer for internet surfing and light gaming it meets my needs. I wouldn't use it in a more demanding rig doing video editing or class \"A\" games. I use my Ryzen R9 3950 PC for that but this unit comes in handy for when I am rendering video projects or when I am having Lara Croft kick some butt. Perhaps this PSU could do it but why torture myself on a basic computer to see. Anyway if you are building a budget PC then it would probably meet your needs too."

My Ram is running an XMP, my CPU is set to auto overclock and my GPU is also set to auto overclocking.\n\nThe cables were more than long enough to reach behind the back side of the case to keep them hidden. They were a bit on the stiff side which turned out to help me getting through some of the more difficult to route spots. I was replacing a lower powered PSU and not building a new machine so I had to work with pre-wired devices.\n\nAs far as fan noise, I have nothing to state bad about the noise. If you take a look at my setup listed above, I have quite a few fans active on my machine. To be honest, I have never heard the fan on this power supply or any others. Once my old GPU would reach the max performance, the fans sounded like they were trying to launch a small plane. My new GPU is so much quieter but still makes more fan noise than the PSU does.\n\nI really love the fact this PSU is a modular cable design. This allowed me to use exactly the cables I needed minimizing the amount of cables in my machine and reducing wire clutter.

        "review": "I recently picked up this PSU for my secondary PC, and I'm pretty happy with it. First off, installation was a breeze. The cables were all long enough to reach where I needed them, and I didn't have any issues plugging everything in.\n\nThis power supply is non-modular, which might be a downside for some people, but honestly, it didn't matter to me. The simple, straightforward design was just what I needed, and it saved me some cash compared to the fancier modular options out there. Another note is the colorful cables kinda stand out, but I don't care about the internal aesthetic of my PC.\n\nFor PSUs I'm all about sticking to trusted brands, and Thermaltake is good enough. It's a solid, no-frills power supply that does its job quietly and efficiently. If you're looking for a simple and reliable solution on a budget, I'd definitely recommend this over some no-name brand. It's a good pick for anyone who wants quality without breaking the bank."

        "review": "Over the course of the last 6 months, I have slowly pieced together components for a new personal gaming PC rig. Between finding stuff through either Amazon or Newegg, waiting for stuff to slowly go on sale or come down close to the MSRP, was like fingernails on a chalkboard. Unfortunately, CoVid-19 has caused a lot of price gouging in various items, especially in the market of PSUs.\nWhen Amazon Prime day 2020 finally came around, I was excited to see what various computer components would be available. The last two items on my list were a PSU and RAM, of which the latter I ended up finding a good buy on a 32g RAM kit. However, I wasn't so lucky on finding the exact PSU to fit my needs. Not wanting to wait until Black Friday, I decided to bite the bullet and to find a top tier PSU, even if I had to splurge on it. I have already spent too much time trying to piece together components that I needed to build this computer incase something didn't work right out of the box.\nSince most of the components in my new gaming PC were from ASUS, this PSU caught my eye. I figured that it would tie into the rest of the components nicely, even though the price was about $30 more than I would have liked to have paid, but was it really worth the $155?? (...this PSU looks so pretty!!) After tossing and turning a few night, and seeing that it was quickly going out of stock, I went ahead and bought this bad boy.\nOn the other hand, not to let you guys think this was an impulse buy, I did some extensive research on this PSU. First off, this particular model won't be found on any current heirarchy chart as ASUS uses another famous and good company that makes really great PSUs: Seasonic. Yup that's right, this uses a modified version of Seasonic's Focus Plus Gold series, which is considered a top end PSU. Secondly, the 10 year warranty was another reason that I knew this was a good buy as well.\nAfter waiting four days for this PSU to come in the mail (and practically losing sleep over it cause I was so excited to finally build my computer) I finally couldn't wait to rip the package open to see all what was inside. What I found was: The PSU itself (duh!), a translucent ziplock baggie with some nice magnets to either put on the PSU, PSU shroud or chassis of your PC case, some small stickers to place on the I/O side of the PSU, the installation booklet, some velcro strips, four screws, and in a separate, sleek looking nylon bag, all the cables necessary to hook up your components to your motherboard, including two SATA cables with four headers and a molex cable. The cables themselves are sleeved as a whole (not individually sleeved) in a sturdy, black nylon material and there are no \"ketchup and mustard\" wires insight. The SATA and the molex cables, however, are the standard flat black cables. These cables are also VERY long, considering that my case is a mid tower ATX case. These could probably easy reach components in a full tower cases using an eATX motherboard without the need for cable extensions. The cables are also very flexible, not stiff like some other PSU brands with flat cables.\nWhen I finally got everything hooked up, and turned it on for the first time, it was beautiful. Even though this PSU has a 0 dB button, with it turned off (the fan constantly running) the fan is virtually silent.\nIn the end, I definitely don't feel guilty splurging on purchasing this product. I definitely recommend ASUS PSU to anyone that wants to add elegance and a reliable PSU to their PC build. It may be a little pricer than some of the other PSUs in the same category, but I guarantee you won't regret it!"

        "review": "Me agrado mucho comprar este producto, siento que valió la pena al sacarlo de su caja y encontrar todo lo que está en la foto.\n\nPara empezar trae algunas pegatinas imantadas para personalizar la fuente, fue un buen detalle. Aclarar que no trae ningún rgb para la gente que a veces solo le interesa eso.\n\nTambién incluye algunas bolsitas con el logo de la marca las cuales voy a guardar porque se me hicieron muy bonitas, esto también lo manejan otras marcas.\n\nCon respecto a los cables creo que si trae los necesarios para una PC actual, traen el suficiente largo, en ningún momento sentí que fueran cortos como me pasó con mi fuente anterior que apenas si llegaban los cables, aunque mi gabinete es media torre, tal vez en una torre completa quedé exacta.\n\nTambién como extra incluye unos cintillos de plástico para amarrar cables y unas cintas de Velcro para el mismo propósito. La verdad muy bonitas.\n\nEs la primer fuente que compro de Asus, siempre he comprado Thermaltake y cooler máster pero me agrado mucho la calidad de los materiales y lo que incluye. La caja llegó sellada en celofán a pesar de ser un producto importado.\n\nCon respecto a la instalación fue muy sencillo e incluye sus 4 tornillos. Algo que me llamo la atención es un botón que trae para que supuestamente haga nada de ruido, el botón dice 0 dB, es decir, cero ruido, lo extraño es que al oprimirlo se apaga el ventilador y sigue encendida la fuente. No comprendo si eso debería ser así porque una fuente siempre debe enfriarse con su ventilador. No he intentado verificar si en algún momento enciende el ventilador con esa opción activada o si tenga otra forma de enfriamiento porque tener el ventilador de la fuente apagado se me hace algo peligroso así que mejor he desactivado esa opción, porque de todas formas la fuente es silenciosa.\n\nEn conclusión creo que es una excelente fuente, tengo poco tiempo con ella, espero me dure muchos años como mis otras fuentes que la más vieja ya casi cumple 15 años y sigue funcionado.\n\nSi te sirvió mi reseña vota que te fue útil"

        "review": "Excellent value for money. The PS is well built and similar in design to all the other basic 13.8V bench power supplies. It measures 13.88VDC with no load. It didn't get warm with a full 20 amp draw for 2 minutes with a 100W CW carrier. I have no doubt it can handle a 30 amp draw for as long as you want to draw that much current. For about half the price of other similar 13.8V 30A supplies it's a good no frills deal. A lot better than the much more expensive Pyramid I initially bought that was DOA. I'm not a brand name guy for most things. They're all made in the same factories these days and just because it has some goofy brand name on it doesn't mean it's any less quality than the regular brands we've all seen for decades."

        "review": "Review update, 8/23/23:\n\nI spoke with a power supply engineer that I've known for years. He advised that a properly designed DC switching supply should not \"bounce on the way down\", but its DC output should degrade smoothly to zero Volts w/o a \"ringing bounce\", and that this kind of bouncing is not good for anything in the \"on position\" that may still be connected to it. With regret, I returned the Jesverty 50A supply for a refund. Amazon was good to its word and processed the refund because I did the return in the initial 30 day ownership period. So, while the supply works great when powering up and staying powered (even when sourcing very high current demands), this shutdown anomaly is enough reason to return it. Sorry, This removes one more star from my rating.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI had a Motorola TPN-1154A linear regulated supply as my main ham station source of DC Voltage. Moto designed this supply to regulate at 14.5VDC with up to a 15A continuous draw (20A on surges) with minimal change in its regulated, nominal Voltage output. I had used this supply for over two decades without incident.\n\nSince I monitor its Voltage with a small DMM module, I recently noticed the Moto supply's output had climbed to 14.9VDC with no load. Most 12VDC devices do not like being fed with DC Voltages much above 15 Volts, so I felt uncomfortable with this recent development and didn't want my nominal Voltage to climb much higher.\n\nAfter much searching at the ham stores and on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Jesverty SPS-5011 to be my new ham station supply. I have owned a number of linear supplies over the years I've been a ham as well as switchers from Icom and MFJ and even a generic LED light string 12V/30A switcher I bought to power an IC-706 radio. Some switchers are better than others. Most regulate their output Voltage quite well. Some, like my generic unit can be a bit noisy with switching regulator noise. The Jesverty SPS-5011 is certainly one of the quieter switcher supplies I've owned.\n\nWith its dual metering, switchable fixed 13.8VDC versus 9-15VDC adjustable modes, noise movement control (moves the AC chopper frequency to move \"birdies\" around), and great current sourcing capability (along with the expected good Voltage regulation, I am very happy with its features and performance.\n\nSince I like to power down my ham station by switching off an AC outlet strip that the Jesverty is plugged into, I have noticed one thing I do NOT like. This single \"nit\" is that unlike the predictable drop of a linear supply's decaying DC output, and not like a similar drop in output when AC is removed from my Icom, MFJ, and even the 12V/30A generic supply...the Jesverty's DC output \"rings\" as it decays.\n\nBy this I mean that the DC output does not drop as a somewhat steady decay when AC is removed (even by switching the Jesverty \"off\" with its front panel power switch) but it actually \"bounces on the way down to zero Volts output\". One can see this with the Jesverty's panel lamps turning off and on several times before finally going out completely. I can also hear some popping in my amplified speakers as this Voltage bounces during its ultimate decay to being totally \"off\".\n\nI'm not sure whether or not this is harmful to any of my equipment, so I do try to always FIRST turn off my radios before \"throwing the big switch\" on the AC strip. Since some of the radios do not have a hard, cold \"off\" mode (some parts of their circuitry is always drawing a bit of current when DC is present on their power cables, and they simply do a soft start when their power switches are depressed) I do have some minor concerns about this bouncy \"on to off\" transition behavior.\n\nThis is not so much a concern for me, however, that I feel I need to return this power supply. The other capabilities this Jesverty 50A supply has, for me, far outweigh this minor concern.\n\nBTW, I diagnosed and repaired the Moto supply's creeping regulated DC Voltage issue and even changed some of its \"select in manufacturing\" resistor values in it to recenter its own DC output to exactly 13.8VDC...but I'm keeping the Jesverty SPS-5011 anyway. I'm that happy with it and feel it's that good of a purchase (unless it dies due to infant mortality)."

In my quest to find new adapters, I came across these and was delighted to see the reviews that said the adapter remained quite cool even at higher loads. The fact that it's UL listed is also nice (the other brand wasn't).\n\nWhen they arrived, I was excited to try them out. I am using them to power a single strip of 12v LED lights that max out at 5A at full brightness. At 8A, this adapter should be well within its rated spec and should not get hot at all. Consistent with the other reviews, the adapter did not get hot. It was actually barely warm at all and this made me very happy.\n\nOn the other hand, as I went to check the barrel connector, it was insanely hot. The rubber(?) around the connector was too hot to touch with my fingertips for more than a second and as I got a little closer, I noticed a not so good smell as if something was melting. Upon visual inspection, there didn't seem to be any melting damage, but the fact that it was so hot was a no go for me as it is to be installed in a plastic housing and I didn't want the plastic to melt, more fumes being created from hot plastics/rubber, and/or risk potential fire of some kind (however small a risk that may be). The connector became this hot even with just half the load of the LED strip (2.5A).\n\nI contacted the seller/manufacturer and to inquire if these connectors are rated for the 8A that the adapter is and also explained my experience with the very hot connectors under just 2.5A load. Their response was that the heat was normal (no it's not) and that my 2.5A load is \"relatively large\" (again, no it's not).\n\nOut of frustration, I purchased a set of metal barrel connectors rated for 10A. Those arrived and I connected them and tested them with 2.5A load and the full 5A load. The metal connector barely became warm.\n\nIn summary - great adapter, but I fully recommend you buy your own female barrel connectors because the ones they include are no good unless you expect to only use a tiny, tiny fraction of the 80% of 8A this adapter is rated for."

        "review": "Seems to work great powering some under the cabinet LED lighting. However, be very cautious of the adapter that comes with it to connect to your LEDs. It is not good for higher current loads. Running close to the rate 6A through this thing might lead to bad problems for you.\n\nI had this powering two approximately 16 foot LED RGBWW strips, each controlled by a wireless LED ballast. One for under the cabinets and one on top to give accent colors. When i had both strips on with a lot of color, the adapter became very hot. Enough that I might have been able to get a burn if I had pulled the adapter off the cord and grabbed the metal with my fingers. I could feel the heat traveling up the cord of the power supply several inches and the rubber was softening. Thinking that maybe I miscalculated the current my setup would draw, I purchased a second of these power supplies. Now each are powering a single strip. But even with halving the load, both adapters get quite warm when I have RGB & WW running. The power supply seems like it is perfectly capable of providing all of the power needed for both strips but that hot adapter is not good at all. Excessive heat + electricity = smoke, fire, fuss, bother, and a very bad day.\n\nI'm still debating it but I might cut the ends off of the power supply's cord and solder them directly to the leads going to the LED ballasts. I think that I would trust a good soldered joint that I created myself rather than those adapters."

It has a green LED indicator that's not too bright (which is good) and a large ferrite EMI ring on the output. It also comes with a screw terminal attachment, which I don't need but will come in handy for future DIY projects. I'm feeling very optimistic about this purchase."

I ran it for over an hour with a 7.5A load and it got warm but not hot. Plus the power-on delay is under 1 second (not 4 seconds like some losers I sent back). I'm sold! Buying more.\n\nNOTE: Another reviewer pointed out how much heat you can get from those standard 12V barrel connectors... and I agree that if you're pulling more than about 5A you should cut off this connector and solder the connections. I've measured in the range of 0.1 ohms per connector junction, which will cost you almost a volt at rated power. If you want full brightness, you don't want 11V to your light strip."

        "review": "I don't really have PSU testing tools, so I defer any serious considerations to them, but this model does have a lot of shining reviews by those who do have the tools (though of course reviews have to always be taken with a grain of salt. Or a whole shaker even these days.)\n\nWhat I can tell is that it has all the outward signs of a quality PSU. It's quite hefty for its size, seems to have a good fan, etc etc. When I measure things like voltage via software (not sure how reliable that is, but it's the best I have,) they seem to be more stable than my previous PSUs.\n\nOne curiosity I don't really know how to explain is it has an extra relay inside doing who knows what. When you first turn things on, it's already able to handle the full power draw of the computer, so it's not like it's a low power switch for suspending or something -- it's straight to 100% before the relay even switches. I'm wondering if it switches on a capacitor after initial startup pull to handle power blinks and the like while avoiding that huge sudden instant draw you'd normally get, but this is merely a guess.\n\nAll in all I'm very much liking it. It's a tiny bit more compact to also work with smaller systems, but also fits fine in my mid tower (these days I guess that's considered a full tower, lol.) The modular cables work fairly well, though I wish the parts that can be put together or pulled apart (like the CPU power connector) snapped together more firmly so you don't have to carefully hold them together while inserting. I was pleasantly surprised it even included the latest 12VHPWR type-4 connector.\n\nI guess if I had to try to choose something to complain about, I wish the power efficiency curve was a bit friendlier towards the low end. Most people aren't actually using anywhere near to 850 watts of power (a lot of people would be very shocked if they plugged their computers into a Kill-a-Watt or similar meter!) For most people normal usage and light gaming is easily going to fall into the bottom side of the curve and get somewhere in the vicinity of 75% efficiency. Ideally one would pick a PSU that more aligns with what the system actually uses (taking care to ensure sufficient current of course) but I can say I picked this one because I needed a PSU I could keep for many years to come and pretty much not even have to think about it no matter what I added to my system (within reason of course. I'm not likely to be adding any of the highest end CPUs or GPUs and especially not dual GPUs which is where one is most likely to start to actually get up to numbers closer to 850.)\n\nI think most people will never come even close to fully utilizing this PSU making it a great option for a huge variety of systems (albeit at the cost of some efficiency loss for most.) From what I can tell I think we can count on it to hold up over time. Even the fan should be decent enough to not die too easily. Especially since most of the time on systems that aren't pushing it really hard the fan runs extremely quietly at a lower RPM."

It's ok. My last PSU was able to completely turn off fan, this one is always running at like 500-700rpm or something. But at this price, and 850W (849 of which are available on the 12V rail!). Also, it has only 2 EPS connectors, but you can always buy your own later. At my purchase price, it is great value for money.\n\nProduct came sealed, but in its brand packaging (no outer Amazon box, which is good for the environment, I guess)\n\nUpdate:\n1 month later, I still have no problems.\nI notice the fan is kind of strange. It's not a smooth sound, it's kind of an warbling, like the blade or bearings are unbalanced. It was like this from the start, and has not changed. Also, the fan is supposed to be sucking from the top and blowing out the rear of the case, but if you put your hand over it you can feel it blowing out the top. Very peculiar. It's like the fan \"sucks\" literally/figuratively. Still, this was an amazing deal, if this lasts 5 years, it gets ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ from me."

Everything in your PC depends on the quality of the voltage it gets. The PSU is responsible to keeping that voltage \"just right\" within the parameters of your PC's requirements. You don't want to \"cheap out\" on that critical job. But some products you can trust, like this one. This is one of my favorite choices (but if you're overclocking a 12900k, you might want a higher wattage!) The two EPS connectors are good if your mobo has two 8-pin EPS headers onboard.

        "review": "I don't really have PSU testing tools, so I defer any serious considerations to them, but this model does have a lot of shining reviews by those who do have the tools (though of course reviews have to always be taken with a grain of salt. Or a whole shaker even these days.)\n\nWhat I can tell is that it has all the outward signs of a quality PSU. It's quite hefty for its size, seems to have a good fan, etc etc. When I measure things like voltage via software (not sure how reliable that is, but it's the best I have,) they seem to be more stable than my previous PSUs.\n\nOne curiosity I don't really know how to explain is it has an extra relay inside doing who knows what. When you first turn things on, it's already able to handle the full power draw of the computer, so it's not like it's a low power switch for suspending or something -- it's straight to 100% before the relay even switches. I'm wondering if it switches on a capacitor after initial startup pull to handle power blinks and the like while avoiding that huge sudden instant draw you'd normally get, but this is merely a guess.\n\nAll in all I'm very much liking it. It's a tiny bit more compact to also work with smaller systems, but also fits fine in my mid tower (these days I guess that's considered a full tower, lol.) The modular cables work fairly well, though I wish the parts that can be put together or pulled apart (like the CPU power connector) snapped together more firmly so you don't have to carefully hold them together while inserting. I was pleasantly surprised it even included the latest 12VHPWR type-4 connector.\n\nI guess if I had to try to choose something to complain about, I wish the power efficiency curve was a bit friendlier towards the low end. Most people aren't actually using anywhere near to 850 watts of power (a lot of people would be very shocked if they plugged their computers into a Kill-a-Watt or similar meter!) For most people normal usage and light gaming is easily going to fall into the bottom side of the curve and get somewhere in the vicinity of 75% efficiency. Ideally one would pick a PSU that more aligns with what the system actually uses (taking care to ensure sufficient current of course) but I can say I picked this one because I needed a PSU I could keep for many years to come and pretty much not even have to think about it no matter what I added to my system (within reason of course. I'm not likely to be adding any of the highest end CPUs or GPUs and especially not dual GPUs which is where one is most likely to start to actually get up to numbers closer to 850.)\n\nI think most people will never come even close to fully utilizing this PSU making it a great option for a huge variety of systems (albeit at the cost of some efficiency loss for most.) From what I can tell I think we can count on it to hold up over time. Even the fan should be decent enough to not die too easily. Especially since most of the time on systems that aren't pushing it really hard the fan runs extremely quietly at a lower RPM."

That part is a struggle for me and more used doing warranty support over the phone. I am visually impaired and emailed the company to explain to them what was going on. I got a phone number and was azked to see if it would help me, sure enough it did. The department dont do warranty replacements but they worked with me and hooked me up with someone who didn't mine taking thire time to help me put in a request. I am happy with thire customer support and was asked if i ever had any problems to call them and they would help me out with any warranty replacements even tho that department didn't support it. Thank you sooo much as that made it a breaze to get something going.

        "review": "Overall, the Corsair RM1000x is a decent power supply unit (PSU) that comes at a relatively good price, especially if you can find it on sale. The sleek design and quiet fan operation are pluses, and the thick, durable cables indicate good build quality. However, there are a few drawbacks to consider.\n\nEase of installation may be a challenge, particularly if you have a smaller case. The cables are stiff and not flat, which can make cable management difficult, and they may not fit through smaller case holes or leave enough clearance to put the back panel back on. However, the cables are wrapped in mesh to help protect them, and once you get them plugged in, they are unlikely to break.\n\nSpeaking of the cables, the marketing images are misleading when it comes to the number of PCIe cables that come with the unit. Corsair should update the product descriptions to match the actual number of cables. The RM1000x comes with 3 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins for a total of 6 8 pin PCIe connections (Though for the newer GPUs it is advised to not use the additional 8 pin), And the RM850x comes with 2 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins as well for a total of 4 8 pin connections.\n\nIn terms of price, the RM1000x is a good value, especially if you can find it on sale. At the time of purchase, it was the cheapest name-brand 80+ Gold rated PSU available. Additionally, the warranty period is very decent, which adds to the overall value.\n\nIn conclusion, the Corsair RM1000x is a solid PSU with a few drawbacks to consider. If you have a larger case and don't mind dealing with stiff cables, this PSU is a good option. The build quality is high, and the price is reasonable, especially when on sale."

        "review": "This is a great quality product from well-known reputable company, a PSU with great modularity and great performance, and frankly a good value. Lots of connectors and on the shift model, if that's what you're looking at side mounted connection points.\n\nHere's where the details come in. Is this PSU is primarily for cases with side mounted PSU slots, while in a wider case this might work in a flat mount situation, most likely you are going to need a fairly wide case to house the wiring coming off the supply without bending the wires too much. Even then in some side mount cases, or the PSU is mounted on its side, the wires sticking upright can still impede on certain things, for example with the Lian-Li o11 dynamic XL, The upright facing ports for the connectors on the wires to plug into impede with the bottom hot swap hard drive bay. Now if I really wanted to press the wires down flat against the power supply unit I could probably still fit the hot swap bay in the case, but it wouldn't give much room for the wires, nor allow for much passive heat dissipation from the PSU. In this particular instance with the case I chose a standard end connector output PSU would have been the better choice, as there is ample room at the end for wiring clutter, but due to the hot swap bay mounted above the power supply unit, the side output of the shift model is not intuitive for my case.\n\nRemoval of the bottom hot swap bay in my case alleviated the issue, but also presents the inconvenience of not having all four hot swap bays available. I never thought I would use this feature, but over the years as I have acquired multiple hard drives and stored up massive amounts of data, it actually comes in handy for moving data back and forth between drives.\n\nSo no stars docked for the design it's actually great, just really think about whether or not you need the side output connectors and whether or not you will have enough room in your case. They make it more convenient to plug and unplug additional wires without having to remove the power supply unit completely, however you may run into spacing issues in smaller cases.\n\nSituationally recommended."

        "review": "I recently purchased the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply, and I must say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and features. Corsair has always been known for delivering high-quality power supplies, and the RM850x is no exception. Here's my review of this remarkable power supply.\n\nFirst and foremost, the efficiency of the RM850x is outstanding. With its 80 PLUS Gold certification, it delivers excellent power efficiency, ensuring that my system consumes less energy and runs cooler. This not only helps in reducing electricity bills but also contributes to the overall longevity and reliability of my system.\n\nThe fully modular design of the RM850x is a game-changer. It allows for easy cable management, as I can connect only the cables I need and keep the rest neatly stored away. This not only enhances the aesthetics of my build but also improves airflow within the case. The modular design also makes installation a breeze, as I can effortlessly connect the required cables without any clutter or hassle.\n\nOne of the standout features of this power supply is its low-noise fan. The fan operates silently under regular loads, and I barely notice its presence. It only kicks in when the system is under heavy load, and even then, the noise levels are impressively low. The Zero RPM fan mode is particularly noteworthy, as it ensures complete silence during idle or low-power usage scenarios. This is a great feature for those who prefer a quiet computing experience.\n\nThe build quality of the RM850x is top-notch. The unit feels solid and durable, and the black finish gives it a sleek and premium look. The cables provided are of high quality and have a premium feel as well. The power supply comes with all the necessary protections, including over-voltage, under-voltage, over-power, over-temperature, and short-circuit protection, ensuring the safety of my components.\n\nIn terms of power delivery, the RM850x handles my system with ease. It provides ample power for my high-end components, including a demanding CPU and a high-performance graphics card. The voltage regulation is excellent, and I have not encountered any stability issues or power-related problems since installing this power supply.\n\nOne minor drawback of the RM850x is its size. It's a bit larger than some other power supplies on the market, so it might not fit into smaller PC cases. However, in most standard ATX cases, this should not be an issue.\n\nOverall, the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply is an exceptional product that delivers on all fronts. Its efficiency, modular design, low-noise fan, and solid build quality make it a reliable choice for any PC enthusiast or gamer. With its impressive performance and thoughtful features, the RM850x is definitely worth the investment for those looking for a high-quality power supply to power their systems.\n\nI highly recommend the Corsair RM850x to anyone in need of a powerful, efficient, and silent power supply for their PC build. Corsair has once again raised the bar with this outstanding product."

        "review": "Got this PSU cause I knew it 1. had more than enough power needed for my new build and 2. the case it went into was designed by corsair, and was able to check clearance on everything. I didn't go with the Shift version of the PSU for the simple reason that although it's unique, I see a lot of people complaining about its practicality. So, I went with the 2021 version of the RM1000x.\n\nThe pros are basic. Strong but also stiff cables with protection in the proper places. Very easy overall install & modularity we've came to be familiar with when it comes to modern PSU's. Quiet operation, & plenty of peace of mind knowing I have plenty of power for my build (6950xt + 13600k).\n\nCONS.... This is the biggest con thus far, and I will complain about it until the end of time. Not that it's ever been okay practice, but having your PCIE cables all have a pigtailed additional 6 pin is just miserable to deal with. My GPU requires two 8 pins & one 6 pin... that's three separate cables with three separate & dangling 6 pin pigtails that'll never be used. I can understand giving only 6+2's even though it should be practice at this point to have some full 8 pin's, but I'll never understand a 6+2's with pigtailed 6 pins on a 1000W unit..... JUST NO. Please, if you're reading this and considering this PSU, please keep in mind to use a separate PCIE 6+2 cable for each connection on the card, AND DO NOT USE THE PIGTAILED 6 PIN THAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM. For lower power cards back in the day this wasn't a huge deal but was still bad practice to daisy chain your PCIE connections like that. Nowadays, with the power these cards are capable of drawing, there's NO REASON a 1000w PSU would even give you the option to daisy chain. A pretty big & detrimental (in my opinion) overlook on Corsair's part. Luckily you can use a cable tie or strap & just bunch them all together but... no one that has built a pc will tell you it looks good.\n\nother than that one major annoyance that I deem to be a con, great power supply."

        "review": "While this looked really cool and I thought it would be a game changer, I would HIGHLY recommend anyone to really check against the case you plan to use and the internal configuration, ie. where the PSU will be mounted.\n\nI used this with a Corsair 7000D, so there was a very good chance it would be compatible. While the idea of easier access of cabling via side mounting to the PSU, the thing I realized is that not all cases are aligned to this orientation. Most cases today assume rear mounted cables. This means that they don't always have enough clearance between the PSU and the side panel to accommodate the cables. Given I had a Corsair case, it wasn't a problem. The motherboard cable did seem to be a tight fit but made it work. With this PSU, I do believe it allowed me to keep the 2nd 3.5\" drive cage closest to the PSU. If I had used traditional rear mounted cable PSU, I definitely would need to sacrifice this drive cage. It wouldn't be a huge deal breaker as I, like most people, are moving away from HDD to SSD.\n\nIt worked out for me. Was it mind blowing amazing or evolutionary? I don't think so... I don't think it will be until case manufacturers start considering this PSU into their designs. For now, it's best compatible with Corsair cases. For other brands, really think through whether you'll have the clearances you need. Otherwise, stick to traditional rear cable mounted PSUs.\n\nThe other reason why I got this particular PSU was because it was the only Corsair one that was ATX3.0 at the 1000W+ range. Needed ATX3.0 to ensure I had the native 12pin power cable for the RTX 4090 to minimize using the octopus adapter that is provide by the card for older PSU. This adapter could increase the chance of the \"melting cable\" situation for NVidia cards. Native 12pin GPU cable is the way to go. It also keeps things clean and minimized."

That meant that the fan blades were hitting the cover and was only fixed after we pulled the cover outward away from the blades inside. For an expensive device you would expect to have a metal covering and not thin plastic. Otherwise the delivery and the PSU works well."

        "review": "I was using XPG Core Reactor 850W Gold PSU to power pcie risers and 3 AMD RX 5700 video cards. My load was more or less constant at less than half the rated capacity. My system ran for better part of two months without problems but all of a sudden two weeks ago I discovered the distinct smell of burning plastic coming from the vicinity of my computer / PSU. With all the advertised built in protections like OCP it was hard for me to get my mind around how the PSU itself could be the source of the issue, but indeed, as per pictures, this is exactly what now seems to be at the root of the issue.\nI only wish I had to deal with coil whine or a PSU that tripped and was no longer functioning. Unfortunately my unit stayed on line creating a potential fire hazard. By virtue of the quality of the power it continued to feed my GPUs, it seems it also did what I now assume is irreparable harm to thousands of dollars of equipment I had connected to it.\nI am thinking that given the cost of components like GPUs relative to PSUs, the cases where PSUs fail taking connected components with them are exceedingly rare. I would expect that, in the case of PSU manufacturers targeting builds with high end components, they would want to go above and beyond in their response to situations where failure of there PSUs have led to significant loss to attached components.\nMy initial attempt to address my situation with XPG was using the facilities of their website on the day my PSU failed. I have still received no response to this overture. A few days back I located and called a toll free number and talked to a service rep. I was underwhelmed with the quality of our discussion. He did say that he would address my case with management and get back to me but he did not commit to any timeline. Yesterday I received an emailed response saying XPG had converged on a rather limited response to my case. They would focus only on the PSU and look into issuing an RMA, assuming I was willing to pay the cost of shipping my PSU back to their facilities in California. In short, with XPG, I was left with a distinct impression that failure of their PSUs in a manner where connected components are lost is a distinct, perhaps even common possibility, and that one should not expect XPG to do much more than make a feeble attempt to replace the PSU itself.\nMy faith in XPG as a brand of PSUs has been destroyed. I don't think I can justify even the cost of one way shipping to get a replacement unit given my new sense of how prone this replacement might be to fail in the same way as my original unit and resulting financial impact."

Turned on and works as expected. For the price, you're getting solid Japanese capacitors all around. Veyr happy here with a nice 10 year warranty on the side. Best part are the cables. I didnt find them too short or long. Just right for the 4000D airflow case. And you get 4 PCIE cables instead of 2 on the 850x which killed it for me. Nice 16awg cables too for the mains. Wont have any issue filling the Nvidia 12VHPWR adapter connectors without falling short. Dont know why other PSU manufacturers cheap out on cables. So far so good XPG.

        "review": "Of note the PSU itself is quite small so perhaps that is part of design. It very frustrating to get everything in the build and then find out this power cable is about 3 inches too short with no way to move parts to accommodate it. Also its a new design designated type 5 and it is not backwards compatible with older designs or so it says in the booklet. Every other power cable I have has been closer to 20inches . If you are using a micro case or maybe some Mid towers it might reach, but not full towers. since I was not able to plug it in I do not know much else about the unit. I am sure its a fine PSU but they really need to put some kind of warning. would it really be that difficult to make the cable a few inches longer. Hopefully I can get a longer cable from Corsair.\n\nUPDATE!! After some assistance with Amazon Customer service, I have been in contact with Corsair regarding the short cables, They are sending me new type 5 cables that are longer to work my full tower install. overall it has taken approximately 10 days to resolve the issue, and probably another few days to receive the cables once shipped. I have increased my rating by 1 star in view of the no hassle resolution. Hopefully They put a new warning somewhere in the description to inform perspective buyers about the short cables.\n\n2nd update, My cables arrived Fedex from Taiwan on the 27th, Now the problem continues they sent cables the exact same length as the originals 400MM or 14 inches, they are still not long enough I need 500 to 600 MM to reach the Mother Board and CPU. I am not sure how they managed to do this They were given a detailed description. I have emailed Corsair again waiting for a response. This started on the 14th or Oct. I will probably be at least another week. I may just have to return the PSU and order a different one."

        "review": "I have used SF750s in multiple builds across several years, and none of them have ever come up with an issue. They hold up fine to the voltage spikes present on higher end RTX 30-series GPUs, and despite the 750W rating on paper they perform fine up to ~900W for brief periods of time. Most of them do make an audible click when they reach a certain temp/power threshold, which is just the relay for the fan activating- but if you can hear this, then you can also be happy that your PC is nice and quiet. Fan noise is negligible.\n\nCorsair provides a full set of braided Type-4 cables with the PSU- note that this does not include a 12VHPWR for the latest Nvidia GPUs, but the adapter works alright (if not, Corsair sells a custom cable, or you can have one custom-made). Their cables are also shorter length to make cable management easier in SFF builds, and velcro cable ties are included as well.\n\nThe SF750 I have now has been used with a 5900X/3080 Ti, 12900K/3090, as well as 5800X3D/4090 in a FormD T1 and has never had issues. QC and customer support are still leagues ahead of Cooler Master, and the SF750 has a proven track record. Unless you are willing to compromise and move up to an SFX-L sized power supply, the SF750 is still the best option for SFX-class PSUs on the market by far. The cases in which you need a 1500W power supply are few and far between."

And this corsair is what I stumbled upon. Very glad I did. Absolutely silent and fits great in my case. Will buy Corsair power supplies from now on.

        "review": "I have only been using it in my new build for about two months now, but it has performed very well so far. I needed to upgrade my power supply with the new power requirements of my 7900 XTX. Under some relatively long gaming sessions I have yet to really hear the fans or notice any coil whine from the power supply. The only reason I downgraded the installation was the fact that the two 4 pin connectors needed to be separated as they were clipped together based on configuration needed. It took forever to figure out that the connectors could be separated as the instructions were not terribly helpful. Only after watching a YouTube video was I able to finally finish up connecting all the pieces. I have to admit, its odd that the fans do not immediately kick in, but its a nifty feature due to only turning on when needed. I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing the higher power output and for the money, it seems like a great purchase. I won't know about longevity for another year at least, but I am pleased so far."

        "review": "Of note the PSU itself is quite small so perhaps that is part of design. It very frustrating to get everything in the build and then find out this power cable is about 3 inches too short with no way to move parts to accommodate it. Also its a new design designated type 5 and it is not backwards compatible with older designs or so it says in the booklet. Every other power cable I have has been closer to 20inches . If you are using a micro case or maybe some Mid towers it might reach, but not full towers. since I was not able to plug it in I do not know much else about the unit. I am sure its a fine PSU but they really need to put some kind of warning. would it really be that difficult to make the cable a few inches longer. Hopefully I can get a longer cable from Corsair.\n\nUPDATE!! After some assistance with Amazon Customer service, I have been in contact with Corsair regarding the short cables, They are sending me new type 5 cables that are longer to work my full tower install. overall it has taken approximately 10 days to resolve the issue, and probably another few days to receive the cables once shipped. I have increased my rating by 1 star in view of the no hassle resolution. Hopefully They put a new warning somewhere in the description to inform perspective buyers about the short cables.\n\n2nd update, My cables arrived Fedex from Taiwan on the 27th, Now the problem continues they sent cables the exact same length as the originals 400MM or 14 inches, they are still not long enough I need 500 to 600 MM to reach the Mother Board and CPU. I am not sure how they managed to do this They were given a detailed description. I have emailed Corsair again waiting for a response. This started on the 14th or Oct. I will probably be at least another week. I may just have to return the PSU and order a different one."

        "review": "I have used SF750s in multiple builds across several years, and none of them have ever come up with an issue. They hold up fine to the voltage spikes present on higher end RTX 30-series GPUs, and despite the 750W rating on paper they perform fine up to ~900W for brief periods of time. Most of them do make an audible click when they reach a certain temp/power threshold, which is just the relay for the fan activating- but if you can hear this, then you can also be happy that your PC is nice and quiet. Fan noise is negligible.\n\nCorsair provides a full set of braided Type-4 cables with the PSU- note that this does not include a 12VHPWR for the latest Nvidia GPUs, but the adapter works alright (if not, Corsair sells a custom cable, or you can have one custom-made). Their cables are also shorter length to make cable management easier in SFF builds, and velcro cable ties are included as well.\n\nThe SF750 I have now has been used with a 5900X/3080 Ti, 12900K/3090, as well as 5800X3D/4090 in a FormD T1 and has never had issues. QC and customer support are still leagues ahead of Cooler Master, and the SF750 has a proven track record. Unless you are willing to compromise and move up to an SFX-L sized power supply, the SF750 is still the best option for SFX-class PSUs on the market by far. The cases in which you need a 1500W power supply are few and far between."

Figured I would sell it once returned and just order another PSU before I shipped it out so I wouldn't have any downtime. Figured I would futureproof my rig and go with a 1000W Gold. And this corsair is what I stumbled upon. Very glad I did. Absolutely silent and fits great in my case. Will buy Corsair power supplies from now on. Only thing that was confusing about this one was that the connections to the actual PSU themselves are smaller than standard, but fine since quality cables are provided in the box."

They're also much lighter as a result, but I think they will have greater longevity, producing less heat, and using newer components. Very satisfied and will likely buy more, to retrofit a retro PC collection, where the PSU's are beginning to fail of old age.\n\nI've read many comments about bad or burning up power supplies, and I guess there's a high proportion that shares factory defects, but mine is absolutely fine. Maybe I got lucky, or maybe the failure will take place down the line, in which case, I'll update the review. I intent to use there with pre-pentium era retro machines. Those draw under 150W, so I'm not really stressing the power supply at all. I do not doubt the fact that the real power rating is 250W max (and not 500W, like the box claims). Just keep it under a lite load. For serious projects, buy rated PSU's for double the price. Don't expect miracles in this price category."

I trusted Amazon and installed but maybe I should be more diligent if I think I am getting an old returned unit that is unreliable."

Noiseless for all intents and purposes. 120mm belly fan won't run most of time (if at all) unlike the 80mm rear fans on the cheapo(er) units. Disregard the reviews submitted by those who would expect champagne on a beer budget. Serious gamers and system builders know better. (Description is incorrect. No fan switch. I presume it is thermostatically controlled. There are very few components in the unit)."

Original PSU is SFX form factor and is one of those briefly manufacured around 2005 or so and having a very high current rating on the 3.3V and 5V rails. The now-failed original had ratings of 3.3V @ 22A and 5V @ 30A. A modern replacement SFX form factor PSU of suitable ratings seems to be unavailable - even the premium high power 800W or 1000W SFX PSU's don't supply anywhere near this much current on the 3.3V and 5V rails.\n\nThis Coolmax PSU is ATX form factor (big) and should not and does not fit the subject PC's SFX form factor (small) case. It was therefore strapped to the side of the PC's case, and the case's cover left off. The Coolmax-provided cables were sufficiently long to reach the motherboard. This jury-rigged external PSU setup is working well. All output voltages are right on spec, and the Coolmax PSU runs cool, even though the Coolmax's 5V rail is rated at somewhat less current than that of the original PSU. The original PSU will be repaired and reinstalled as time permits, but until then, the old PC will chug on, powered by the externally-mounted Coolmax."

I had a budget of $210, and i got the Sapphire Radeon R7 260X(Which is an amazing GPU by the way, check it out). The graphics card was about $150 and i needed something that could fit in my budget. Being priced at approximately $31, this was a perfect fit for me. At $193, i got 2 day shipping and got the parts.\n\nHOWEVER: When i was installing this, i got a bit confused on the parts. It has multiple Peripherals, and only 2 SATAs. Now, The 2 SATAs i used for my 2 hard drives, but my DVD drives were unpowered, so they would not work. Be sure to look at the box, and it will tell you all the parts you need. So i ordered 2 adapters for Male SATA to Female Peripherals, at $4 a piece. Add another $8 to the original $193, you end up with $201.\n\nWhen using the product: This Power supply is off the rockers. The fan is so quiet, i can barely tell that the Computer is on. It has 380W Dedicated to all other accessories like Graphics Cards, etc. The system i have only uses 120W out of the 500W total. This thing is absolutely perfect, and when matched with the Sapphire Radeon R7 260X, this system can be used as an ultimate Desktop.\n\nMy Specs:\n\nIntel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33 GHz\n4.00 GB DDR2 Ram\nWindows 8.1 Pro\nSapphire Radeon R7 260X- 2GB GDDR5, with DVI, HDMI, and Display Port(Comes with DVI to VGA Adapter)\nDell Inspiron 530 Model Case(2009 Built)\n\nIf you are looking to upgrade your power for gaming,etc. Then pair this with the Graphics card i mentioned. But ultimately, This Power Supply has got to be the best power supply i have ever bought(The only one ive ever bought as well :D). $31 Well spent on a great piece of equipment!!\n\n4 Stars rated since i had to buy the Peripheral Adapters."

        "review": "One of the most important parts of a PC build is the PSU and the attachment cables that come with it, neglecting your motherboard with strangulating crisscrossing cables is just asking for trouble. I had to compromise my graphics card and half the components on my MOBO to get a connection to my CPU. Power units are supposed to have enough cable to go around, not across the motherboard and I had to flip the unit upsidedown to bring the cables closer to the motherboard So I could even have a chance of hooking up the 4pin CPU power Also, the gauge of wire is way too thin for proper current flow that would bottleneck the power causing heat and resistance, making connectors wear out faster and possibly damaging your motherboard. Also, if you have a 4/6/8 pin power connectors for your graphics card, then you have a choice of not plugging in your card or not plugging in o your CPU or buying an adaptor connector to daisy-chain 1-4 pin into 2-4 pin connectors for an 8 pin connector. It would be useless, as the PSU couldn't maintain that kind of current flow with cables it has now. This PSU is not for performance or even for a light gaming rig. Sure it is useful for repowering old hp and dell PC's as most of those rigs have top down PSU's (unit is above motherboard), or middle left of the board and that they rarely go above 300 watts, I decided not to risk my rig in an effort to save money, the monetary damages would far exceed the cost of 20 of theses PSU's"

        "review": "Overall, the Corsair RM1000x is a decent power supply unit (PSU) that comes at a relatively good price, especially if you can find it on sale. The sleek design and quiet fan operation are pluses, and the thick, durable cables indicate good build quality. However, there are a few drawbacks to consider.\n\nEase of installation may be a challenge, particularly if you have a smaller case. The cables are stiff and not flat, which can make cable management difficult, and they may not fit through smaller case holes or leave enough clearance to put the back panel back on. However, the cables are wrapped in mesh to help protect them, and once you get them plugged in, they are unlikely to break.\n\nSpeaking of the cables, the marketing images are misleading when it comes to the number of PCIe cables that come with the unit. Corsair should update the product descriptions to match the actual number of cables. The RM1000x comes with 3 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins for a total of 6 8 pin PCIe connections (Though for the newer GPUs it is advised to not use the additional 8 pin), And the RM850x comes with 2 PCIe cables that terminate in 2 8 pins as well for a total of 4 8 pin connections.\n\nIn terms of price, the RM1000x is a good value, especially if you can find it on sale. At the time of purchase, it was the cheapest name-brand 80+ Gold rated PSU available. Additionally, the warranty period is very decent, which adds to the overall value.\n\nIn conclusion, the Corsair RM1000x is a solid PSU with a few drawbacks to consider. If you have a larger case and don't mind dealing with stiff cables, this PSU is a good option. The build quality is high, and the price is reasonable, especially when on sale."

        "review": "This is a great quality product from well-known reputable company, a PSU with great modularity and great performance, and frankly a good value. Lots of connectors and on the shift model, if that's what you're looking at side mounted connection points.\n\nHere's where the details come in. Is this PSU is primarily for cases with side mounted PSU slots, while in a wider case this might work in a flat mount situation, most likely you are going to need a fairly wide case to house the wiring coming off the supply without bending the wires too much. Even then in some side mount cases, or the PSU is mounted on its side, the wires sticking upright can still impede on certain things, for example with the Lian-Li o11 dynamic XL, The upright facing ports for the connectors on the wires to plug into impede with the bottom hot swap hard drive bay. Now if I really wanted to press the wires down flat against the power supply unit I could probably still fit the hot swap bay in the case, but it wouldn't give much room for the wires, nor allow for much passive heat dissipation from the PSU. In this particular instance with the case I chose a standard end connector output PSU would have been the better choice, as there is ample room at the end for wiring clutter, but due to the hot swap bay mounted above the power supply unit, the side output of the shift model is not intuitive for my case.\n\nRemoval of the bottom hot swap bay in my case alleviated the issue, but also presents the inconvenience of not having all four hot swap bays available. I never thought I would use this feature, but over the years as I have acquired multiple hard drives and stored up massive amounts of data, it actually comes in handy for moving data back and forth between drives.\n\nSo no stars docked for the design it's actually great, just really think about whether or not you need the side output connectors and whether or not you will have enough room in your case. They make it more convenient to plug and unplug additional wires without having to remove the power supply unit completely, however you may run into spacing issues in smaller cases.\n\nSituationally recommended."

        "review": "I recently purchased the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply, and I must say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and features. Corsair has always been known for delivering high-quality power supplies, and the RM850x is no exception. Here's my review of this remarkable power supply.\n\nFirst and foremost, the efficiency of the RM850x is outstanding. With its 80 PLUS Gold certification, it delivers excellent power efficiency, ensuring that my system consumes less energy and runs cooler. This not only helps in reducing electricity bills but also contributes to the overall longevity and reliability of my system.\n\nThe fully modular design of the RM850x is a game-changer. It allows for easy cable management, as I can connect only the cables I need and keep the rest neatly stored away. This not only enhances the aesthetics of my build but also improves airflow within the case. The modular design also makes installation a breeze, as I can effortlessly connect the required cables without any clutter or hassle.\n\nOne of the standout features of this power supply is its low-noise fan. The fan operates silently under regular loads, and I barely notice its presence. It only kicks in when the system is under heavy load, and even then, the noise levels are impressively low. The Zero RPM fan mode is particularly noteworthy, as it ensures complete silence during idle or low-power usage scenarios. This is a great feature for those who prefer a quiet computing experience.\n\nThe build quality of the RM850x is top-notch. The unit feels solid and durable, and the black finish gives it a sleek and premium look. The cables provided are of high quality and have a premium feel as well. The power supply comes with all the necessary protections, including over-voltage, under-voltage, over-power, over-temperature, and short-circuit protection, ensuring the safety of my components.\n\nIn terms of power delivery, the RM850x handles my system with ease. It provides ample power for my high-end components, including a demanding CPU and a high-performance graphics card. The voltage regulation is excellent, and I have not encountered any stability issues or power-related problems since installing this power supply.\n\nOne minor drawback of the RM850x is its size. It's a bit larger than some other power supplies on the market, so it might not fit into smaller PC cases. However, in most standard ATX cases, this should not be an issue.\n\nOverall, the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply is an exceptional product that delivers on all fronts. Its efficiency, modular design, low-noise fan, and solid build quality make it a reliable choice for any PC enthusiast or gamer. With its impressive performance and thoughtful features, the RM850x is definitely worth the investment for those looking for a high-quality power supply to power their systems.\n\nI highly recommend the Corsair RM850x to anyone in need of a powerful, efficient, and silent power supply for their PC build. Corsair has once again raised the bar with this outstanding product."

        "review": "Got this PSU cause I knew it 1. had more than enough power needed for my new build and 2. the case it went into was designed by corsair, and was able to check clearance on everything. I didn't go with the Shift version of the PSU for the simple reason that although it's unique, I see a lot of people complaining about its practicality. So, I went with the 2021 version of the RM1000x.\n\nThe pros are basic. Strong but also stiff cables with protection in the proper places. Very easy overall install & modularity we've came to be familiar with when it comes to modern PSU's. Quiet operation, & plenty of peace of mind knowing I have plenty of power for my build (6950xt + 13600k).\n\nCONS.... This is the biggest con thus far, and I will complain about it until the end of time. Not that it's ever been okay practice, but having your PCIE cables all have a pigtailed additional 6 pin is just miserable to deal with. My GPU requires two 8 pins & one 6 pin... that's three separate cables with three separate & dangling 6 pin pigtails that'll never be used. I can understand giving only 6+2's even though it should be practice at this point to have some full 8 pin's, but I'll never understand a 6+2's with pigtailed 6 pins on a 1000W unit..... JUST NO. Please, if you're reading this and considering this PSU, please keep in mind to use a separate PCIE 6+2 cable for each connection on the card, AND DO NOT USE THE PIGTAILED 6 PIN THAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM. For lower power cards back in the day this wasn't a huge deal but was still bad practice to daisy chain your PCIE connections like that. Nowadays, with the power these cards are capable of drawing, there's NO REASON a 1000w PSU would even give you the option to daisy chain. A pretty big & detrimental (in my opinion) overlook on Corsair's part. Luckily you can use a cable tie or strap & just bunch them all together but... no one that has built a pc will tell you it looks good.\n\nother than that one major annoyance that I deem to be a con, great power supply."

        "review": "While this looked really cool and I thought it would be a game changer, I would HIGHLY recommend anyone to really check against the case you plan to use and the internal configuration, ie. where the PSU will be mounted.\n\nI used this with a Corsair 7000D, so there was a very good chance it would be compatible. While the idea of easier access of cabling via side mounting to the PSU, the thing I realized is that not all cases are aligned to this orientation. Most cases today assume rear mounted cables. This means that they don't always have enough clearance between the PSU and the side panel to accommodate the cables. Given I had a Corsair case, it wasn't a problem. The motherboard cable did seem to be a tight fit but made it work. With this PSU, I do believe it allowed me to keep the 2nd 3.5\" drive cage closest to the PSU. If I had used traditional rear mounted cable PSU, I definitely would need to sacrifice this drive cage. It wouldn't be a huge deal breaker as I, like most people, are moving away from HDD to SSD.\n\nIt worked out for me. Was it mind blowing amazing or evolutionary? I don't think so... I don't think it will be until case manufacturers start considering this PSU into their designs. For now, it's best compatible with Corsair cases. For other brands, really think through whether you'll have the clearances you need. Otherwise, stick to traditional rear cable mounted PSUs.\n\nThe other reason why I got this particular PSU was because it was the only Corsair one that was ATX3.0 at the 1000W+ range. Needed ATX3.0 to ensure I had the native 12pin power cable for the RTX 4090 to minimize using the octopus adapter that is provide by the card for older PSU. This adapter could increase the chance of the \"melting cable\" situation for NVidia cards. Native 12pin GPU cable is the way to go. It also keeps things clean and minimized."

        "review": "This would be a great cable extension kit except that the color of the PCI-E 12VHPWR cable doesn't match the other cables. The difference is immediately noticeable as they are pretty different shades of white with the 12VHPWR being much brighter white. The wire gage is also different, but that doesn't bother me as much.\n\nOtherwise, the cables are very nice quality, the 24 Pin (Motherboard) and 8 Pin EPS (CPU) connectors are a thick gage that was easy to train and looks great. The included cable combs are surprisingly easy to get into place and slide easily enough to make training the cables very doable. The 12VHPWR cable comes with cable combs already attached which is a plus.\n\nIf the colors matched (or were at least a bit closer together) for all the cables this would be a 5/5... as is it's a good quality set of extensions limited by the fact that it's a bit of a mess aesthetically."

It's a fairly decent build quality for such a cheap power supply.\nCables and connections all feel higher quality than whatever OEM Dell PSU lived in my PC before. Installed perfect, booted perfect. The 3-year warrenty says a lot about the components you can't see though lol so don't expect long lifespan or stellar performance if your PC is full of more modern components pushing more wattage. Is this a useful power supply for some folks in some situations? Yes. Is it low teir? Also yes. But hey, if your expectations are in line with the reality of it's flaws, it does the job just fine."

Is dangerous if you don't know what you're doing; and 2: The Noctua fan doesn't move as much air as the stock fan, which will lead to the PSU heating up. Not good. You are paying a premium for the form factor here. It's not a bargain, but it's not a bad product either. It's fine, and if you're building a really small PC, this is the way to go.

Si los lados laterales de SX-300B tocan paneles del gabinete - podrían transmitir el zumbido de ventilador (se corrige con juntas o remaches de silicona). A carga baja su ventilador siempre gira al mínimo preconfigurado. Pero la mitad del ventilador está tapada de fábrica con placa de plástico transparente y fijada directamente en él, con objetivo de crear el túnel de enfriamiento, aumentando el flujo de aíre en parte más profunda del dispositivo, que puede crear ruido adicional.\n--- Sus condensadores principales y secundarios no son japoneses.\n\nConclusión:\nSX-300B es la fuente certificada y segura a precio accesible. Es conveniente para sistemas de bajo consumo, en especial con gráficos integrados, como CPUs R5 5600G (consume en carga máxima solo 100W) o R7 5700G (consume en carga máxima 150W).\nPara mejorar la sonoridad de SX-300B le quité por completo al ventilador la placa de plástico transparente (tunneling) y además lo instalé con unos remaches de silicona en vez de tornillos - para eliminar vibraciones y posible zumbido."

        "review": "I used this power supply when building a small PC around a Mini-ITX motherboard. I needed a \"Flex ATX\" power supply to fit in the small PC case. This power supply fit perfectly. My main concern is that I am not sure if the fan works. I've never seen it come on . The PC uses an Intel 12400 which has a TDP of 65 watts. With no other large power consuming components in the build, this PC does not use much power, therefore the power supply is not working too hard. So maybe the power supply doesn't need to turn on its fan. One option would be to include a switch to allow the fan to run full time or only when thermally needed.\n\nThis power supply does include all of the usual standard connectors, even a floppy drive connector. This a non-modular power supply, so you can't remove any of these cables. In a small PC, these cables get in the way. So be aware of the potential concerns there. Yes you could cut off and cap off the unneeded wires, but that will go beyond what most people want to do.\n\nUltimately this power supply did meet my needs and it looks like about the only name brand Flex ATX power supply that looked viable. I would buy this again."

That meant that the fan blades were hitting the cover and was only fixed after we pulled the cover outward away from the blades inside. For an expensive device you would expect to have a metal covering and not thin plastic. Otherwise the delivery and the PSU works well."

        "review": "I was using XPG Core Reactor 850W Gold PSU to power pcie risers and 3 AMD RX 5700 video cards. My load was more or less constant at less than half the rated capacity. My system ran for better part of two months without problems but all of a sudden two weeks ago I discovered the distinct smell of burning plastic coming from the vicinity of my computer / PSU. With all the advertised built in protections like OCP it was hard for me to get my mind around how the PSU itself could be the source of the issue, but indeed, as per pictures, this is exactly what now seems to be at the root of the issue.\nI only wish I had to deal with coil whine or a PSU that tripped and was no longer functioning. Unfortunately my unit stayed on line creating a potential fire hazard. By virtue of the quality of the power it continued to feed my GPUs, it seems it also did what I now assume is irreparable harm to thousands of dollars of equipment I had connected to it.\nI am thinking that given the cost of components like GPUs relative to PSUs, the cases where PSUs fail taking connected components with them are exceedingly rare. I would expect that, in the case of PSU manufacturers targeting builds with high end components, they would want to go above and beyond in their response to situations where failure of there PSUs have led to significant loss to attached components.\nMy initial attempt to address my situation with XPG was using the facilities of their website on the day my PSU failed. I have still received no response to this overture. A few days back I located and called a toll free number and talked to a service rep. I was underwhelmed with the quality of our discussion. He did say that he would address my case with management and get back to me but he did not commit to any timeline. Yesterday I received an emailed response saying XPG had converged on a rather limited response to my case. They would focus only on the PSU and look into issuing an RMA, assuming I was willing to pay the cost of shipping my PSU back to their facilities in California. In short, with XPG, I was left with a distinct impression that failure of their PSUs in a manner where connected components are lost is a distinct, perhaps even common possibility, and that one should not expect XPG to do much more than make a feeble attempt to replace the PSU itself.\nMy faith in XPG as a brand of PSUs has been destroyed. I don't think I can justify even the cost of one way shipping to get a replacement unit given my new sense of how prone this replacement might be to fail in the same way as my original unit and resulting financial impact."

Turned on and works as expected. For the price, you're getting solid Japanese capacitors all around. Veyr happy here with a nice 10 year warranty on the side. Best part are the cables. I didnt find them too short or long. Just right for the 4000D airflow case. And you get 4 PCIE cables instead of 2 on the 850x which killed it for me. Nice 16awg cables too for the mains. Wont have any issue filling the Nvidia 12VHPWR adapter connectors without falling short. Dont know why other PSU manufacturers cheap out on cables. So far so good XPG.

Or a whole shaker even these days.)\n\nWhat I can tell is that it has all the outward signs of a quality PSU. It's quite hefty for its size, seems to have a good fan, etc etc. When I measure things like voltage via software (not sure how reliable that is, but it's the best I have,) they seem to be more stable than my previous PSUs.\n\nOne curiosity I don't really know how to explain is it has an extra relay inside doing who knows what. When you first turn things on, it's already able to handle the full power draw of the computer, so it's not like it's a low power switch for suspending or something -- it's straight to 100% before the relay even switches. I'm wondering if it switches on a capacitor after initial startup pull to handle power blinks and the like while avoiding that huge sudden instant draw you'd normally get, but this is merely a guess.\n\nAll in all I'm very much liking it. It's a tiny bit more compact to also work with smaller systems, but also fits fine in my mid tower (these days I guess that's considered a full tower, lol.) The modular cables work fairly well, though I wish the parts that can be put together or pulled apart (like the CPU power connector) snapped together more firmly so you don't have to carefully hold them together while inserting. I was pleasantly surprised it even included the latest 12VHPWR type-4 connector.\n\nI guess if I had to try to choose something to complain about, I wish the power efficiency curve was a bit friendlier towards the low end. Most people aren't actually using anywhere near to 850 watts of power (a lot of people would be very shocked if they plugged their computers into a Kill-a-Watt or similar meter!) For most people normal usage and light gaming is easily going to fall into the bottom side of the curve and get somewhere in the vicinity of 75% efficiency. Ideally one would pick a PSU that more aligns with what the system actually uses (taking care to ensure sufficient current of course) but I can say I picked this one because I needed a PSU I could keep for many years to come and pretty much not even have to think about it no matter what I added to my system (within reason of course. I'm not likely to be adding any of the highest end CPUs or GPUs and especially not dual GPUs which is where one is most likely to start to actually get up to numbers closer to 850.)\n\nI think most people will never come even close to fully utilizing this PSU making it a great option for a huge variety of systems (albeit at the cost of some efficiency loss for most.) From what I can tell I think we can count on it to hold up over time. Even the fan should be decent enough to not die too easily. Especially since most of the time on systems that aren't pushing it really hard the fan runs extremely quietly at a lower RPM."

That part is a struggle for me and more used doing warranty support over the phone. I am visually impaired and emailed the company to explain to them what was going on. I got a phone number and was azked to see if it would help me, sure enough it did. The department dont do warranty replacements but they worked with me and hooked me up with someone who didn't mine taking thire time to help me put in a request. I am happy with thire customer support and was asked if i ever had any problems to call them and they would help me out with any warranty replacements even tho that department didn't support it. Thank you sooo much as that made it a breaze to get something going. I try to be independent and do something that would work for me. :) i hope replacement works i can understand not all defects are detected. It really ment a lot how the supprt team helped me"

Note that you'll probably need to get an extra PCIe cable if you have a GPU with 3 pins though, and PSU cables are NOT universal so you'll need to make sure they're designed for the RM."

        "review": "This unit came in a Cyberpower prebuilt I bought. Been troubleshooting spontaneous lockups and reboots after exiting a game or other high workload for the GPU (RTX3070). Found 12V feeds to the MB and 12 pin connectors to the GPU where sagging from 11.8x (Low to begin with) down to as low as 11.3-11.4 under load and then overshooting up to 12.3V when exiting a heavy load situation. Also .2V difference in two separate 8 pin connectors at all time, they're not balanced on the unit I have.\n\nLong story still long, I replaced it with an EVGA 750G+ and no more issues. Voltages are spot on and rock solid at all times. Price difference between the Apevia unit and the EVGA is almost $10 cheaper at this time so it's a no brainer if I was in the market for a PS, by name brand (EVGA, Seasonic, Etc). I feel lucky my RTX3070 wasn't damaged.\n\nNot impressed with Cyberpower either for using junk on a $2000+ prebuilt but about what I expected. With component availability/prices the way they are building from scratch just isn't practical right now."

Still no change.\n\nAfter attempting a few other things like overclocking my CPU and Ram and constantly watching my stats. I decided to pull the plug on an EVGA 850w Gold and my computer has been running stable since.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend a random brand for a PSU. Go with the well regarded ones for $20 more."

        "review": "Just got it installed and wired. I bought this one because it has four PCIe plugs, seven SATA connections, even has 3 old school IDE connectors. The cabling is wrapped nicely in black mesh, which I didn't expect from a budget unit. It isn't modular, but the wiring is more than long enough for my mid ATX tower. Some ppl said the wiring is too short?? I have a mid tower and I had to curl amd toe back most of it. I guess maybe a full size tower would need creative routing and component placement, but the wiring on this unit is a little longer than standard. I've built many systems- some mine and quite a few for friends and such. These are standard length if not a bit longer. It's hard to find a PSU with more than 4 or 5 SATA connectors for less than 100$. This has 7. I have 5 HDD and 2 DVD writers so I need at least 7 without a hub. I can't hear ot at all. I only hear my case fans and the CPU fan. So far, I'm very happy with it. It is puttimg out nominally about 550W but specs say it can peak short bursts of over 850. IDK about that, I've icky had it for a few hours. Very happy with this purchase. Price is phenomenal for 800W with this many connectors."

And for the most part I can confirm that they do produce quality products now. However, there's just one problem I have with this 800W Gold power supply. The noise. The fan used to cool this PSU runs constantly, and sounds like a very muffled little engine just put-putting along in there. Since the rest of my PC is virtually silent, the noise from the PSU fan is very prominent. Gaming sounds fine, since the rest of my PC spins up anyway, but while editing photos and doing homework, this thing gets really irritating. I just can't keep a PSU in my PC that sounds like this constantly. Otherwise, if you already have noisy components in your PC, like an AIO pump or fans that stay on, then go for it. You can't beat this wattage and efficiency rating for the price."

        "review": "I think that this could be a terrific bargain - due to two major reasons. Apevia (formerly Aspire) is still trying to \"fix\" an image that rightfully came from selling really bad power supplies in the early 2000's. And, this was largely the result of using Young Year as their primary OEM, a Taiwanese manufacturer that built some of the most inferior PSUs made and mislabeling them with false specifications.\n\nAlmost every major PSU brand uses an OEM. Most don’t actually manufacture power supplies, they use an OEM manufacturer. Apevia now uses a reputable and above average manufacturer now. Andyson is not as well known as some of the more prestigious OEMs like Seasonic or FSP - but they have a solid reputation. When you look at legit and credible reviews of their H6 800W (AD-800GGF) power supply (which coincidentally share the same model number) such as Johnny Guru and others online, its been noted for its excellent voltage stability, very good to excellent ripple control and nice looking power on transient results. Personally, I think it's the same exact unit - only relabeled. The only knocks are the lack of modular cables. The build is solid. \"Electrolytics are mostly the good stuff with most of them Chemi-Con or Nichicon.\" A retail Andyson 800w Gold PSU sells for over a $100. But the company is not well known and still struggling for market share. So this is why Apevia with the market power is rebranding them.\n\nYou will notice that major builders, including Cyber Power, are using Apevia power supplies in their gaming systems. They're not doing this without a lot of thought. Andyson OEMs, rebranded as Apevia PSUs, are solid, well priced power supplies built well with reputable credentials. At low prices two to three times less the other good OEMs.\n\nI will update this review - when the power supply arrives. I am replacing a 600w Thermaltake PSU in my 11 year old's computer. He has an AMD 1600 (really a 2600) which i bought here on Amazon on an MSI 450B motherboard as well as a PowerColor Red Devil RX 580. Since I am OC', both are pretty power hungry. This PSU one carries a 3 year warranty - which isn't too bad. And using it's old history against them. Hope this helps everyone and let everyone get a fair review of this PSU. I'll post again once i install the PSU.\n\nUpdate: It arrived last week. My son, an avid gamer - has played on his esports rig all weekend. Not one hiccup. Build is solid and the fan is better than expected. Have not had any problems. I'm not going to compare the heft of this PSU to my 1600W but its seems very solid. No modular cables but everything is sleeved. And surprisingly, it has a controlled fan - which I didn't expect. Very quiet. More than I expected. Overall, I'm giving this a 4 for build and use and a 5 for value. Seriously, I think I got an 800W Gold Certified PSU by Andyson for $70. That is a bargain.\n\nJust an important note: Please remember that PSU's are hit or miss. I can't verify the QC but overall, Andyson's QC is much better than most. I got a good one. Most have according to the review stars. YMMV."

        "review": "Make sure you're aware this is not going to mount into a mid tower case with the \"normal\" PSU mounting without an additional adapter plate as this is a flex ATX PSU. If you're going this route, you will likely need either extension cables or a different CPU or motherboard power cable, as these might not be long enough for such case.\n\nAs you can see in my picture, I ignored all of my own advice because I got this in an attempt to revive my very old computer as a bench setup vs a full time use \"clean\" build. I ended up just two sided taping the psu down to the bottom of the case & running the cables around in the most chaotic way possible. In my case, the CPU power cable was long enough, but the motherboard power cable was just shy of being long enough if I were to move the PSU back flush with the back of the case.\n\nAnyway, it works. I'm using it to power an old and bulldozer 6100 which should be just over 100 watts at peak, and my old GTX 970 which is somewhere around 160 watts at peak. Including everything I'm probably close to 300W total, which is shy of the 400W claimed rating (which you should always aim to be below the rating in my opinion). I played a few older games and likely didn't reach the 300W theoretical power draw but I didn't see any power issues for what it's worth. I lack tools to get better current or power draw estimates than that.\n\nI've never had a flex PSU before so this might be standard, but one thing I did notice is the lack of a on off switch near the AC plug on the back.\n\nThe fan is quiet enough, I didn't notice any noise over the rest of the computer.\n\nAs for pricing, it seems similarly priced to other Flex PSU. If you can live with or otherwise would want a standard PSU, i would stick with that vs this just for the price difference. Of you absolutely need a flex PSU, I don't see any reason to not get this one.\n\nIt's a power supply and it currently supplies power like i would expect so that's a 5 star from me. This will probably have an easier life in this bench setup that most people, so as for the longevity of it I doubt I'll ever see an issue with it. I'll edit the review if it does stop working on me soon enough for me to remember having left this review."

        "review": "#ITEM: 400W Power Supply Flex ATX. #CONCLUSION: It's a great power supply. Fan is pretty quiet and wiring is easy. #WHOAMI: I'm an inventor/engineer, so I go deep on design and details. #MYAPPLICATION: I have a 1U server board that needed a power supply. It's hard to find a supply that will fit in a 1u case, but this one fit well. The fan is quiet, and it handles the draw of the CPU at 100% without any trouble. Normal server power supplies are crazy loud, so it was great to find this quiet power supply. Now I can use this machine as a daily desktop machine. #ENJOY"

        "review": "This is not a bad modular power supply. The 400 watt power supply is not too bad for what I need it for. It is not something you can really use for a crypto mining setup but this can be used to power your computer and GPU. I actually like having this in my small ITX case as it is a definite space saver. The installation can be tricky depending on what kind of case you have but I did use it as my motherboard testing center until I use it for my mini PC. In terms of pricing, I am not entirely sure it is worth the price due to the amount of modular plugs and the watts it provides. There is nothing too fancy about this in terms of color or look. It is just a simple black color PSU. It is just a smaller size. The fan is a bit noisy though. I honestly not surprised considering the compact size of this device. The connectors are all pretty simple. It is sturdy and easy to plug in. It has the same latches that prevent you from accidentally pulling the plug out. Depending on what kind of GPU, you can run a GPU on this power supply. The power supply does get a bit hot which makes me worried about it burning out. Overall I think this is an okay power supply but I cannot justify the high price as it is only 400 w. The power supply does run a bit too loud and hot but this is probably due to the compact size and fan. The plugs provided are enough to start and power most mid size computers but just know it is only 400 w. It can be mounted but it can be tricky depending on what kind of case you are mounting to."

I absolutely hate that it doesn't mount in the PSU area of the case. I really wish that it came with an adapter that would make it a little more elegant than just hanging out in the bottom of the case un-mounted. A bit noisy and has cycled on me a couple of times so I'm not sure if the PSU is faulty or if I'm demanding too much power from it. Will replace with something bigger like 750 watt that mounts in the intended spot for a PSU."

        "review": "Slowly reassembling a mini ITX HTPC as I get various parts in hand for it. Wanted a better PSU as the existing one was a 275watt. This'll do it!\n\nIt's an older AMD with a blasted 95w CPU in it (try finding a good heatsink for this size case.... ew!), so I need something that can handle that, a low-profile 1050, and have enough overhead remaining (I'm of the mindset that one should determine their max load and get a PSU that can handle that plus another 30-40% beyond max TDP).\n\nThat this PSU is modular is a big deal, because if you deal with mini-ITX, you know you need to be creative in hiding all your cables properly. Thus far I haven't witnessed any rebooting as others have described, but I will certainly keep an eye out for that."

The difference is immediately noticeable as they are pretty different shades of white with the 12VHPWR being much brighter white. The wire gage is also different, but that doesn't bother me as much.\n\nOtherwise, the cables are very nice quality, the 24 Pin (Motherboard) and 8 Pin EPS (CPU) connectors are a thick gage that was easy to train and looks great. The included cable combs are surprisingly easy to get into place and slide easily enough to make training the cables very doable. The 12VHPWR cable comes with cable combs already attached which is a plus.\n\nIf the colors matched (or were at least a bit closer together) for all the cables this would be a 5/5... as is it's a good quality set of extensions limited by the fact that it's a bit of a mess aesthetically."

More people have been and continue to check out their entire line of products, as this brand has been gaining more and more attention over the years. I highly recommend not just this power supply unit, but any of their offerings due to price & performance. When it comes to a power supply you I would never cheap out and I've always recommended and purchased ONLY solid, well known and thoroughly researched power supply units.\n\nWith that said, however, I've watched this company rise from nothing & can say for certainty that I have no worry or fear that this will short out or mess up my $3000+ dollar pc gaming build. It provides solid & consistent power, plenty of it too, to all of my internal components. The RGB lighting looks stellar, and is a nice bonus to top it all off."

I was hoping that maybe there was a new revision that I would get that would resolve this stupid fan curve issue. I was disappointed to find out it ramps up and down constantly. It's almost like there is no PWM but just a simple binary fan execution.\n\nAlbeit, when the fan ramps up I'm usually gaming a wearing a headset and when I'm not gaming... well the GPU is pretty much just idling or consuming very little power for video watching that it's not enough to trip the 15% load limit for zero fan.\n\nIt's annoying. And loud. I'm hoping Coolermaster does something about it but it sounds like all you can do is RMA it for a refund or exchange but most likely you'll just get the same revision of unit.\n\nEverything else is good. Cables are flexible and all black. Lots of output connections. Comes with a ATX bracket so you can use it with a standard ATX case."

I had three higher end corsairs fail right out of the box's during testing. The first one lit my board on fire before I started getting smarter. So ya never know right? This mighty little 850w fired right up, the testing mod says it is hitting at 110ms boot up speed which is at the highest end of the spectrum. May be due to the smaller caps they are using? My very first water-cooled mini ITX build so a small form size supply is crucial. I did my homework before ordering this one and time will tell how well it functions after I run it for awhile. Sadly my Mini ITX board is bad (turns out someone substituted a used bad board in a new box, yeah it happens to other people also). So this will sit a little longer before I can review it properly under load. All I have done so far is power up my water pump circuit and the fan hasn't come on yet. All I can say is the build quality is top notch!"

It also comes with a 3yr warranty.\n\nI checked the datasheet specs on the manufacturer’s site for this driver and it seems the specs are a bit different. It shows a max of 2000MB/s Read and 1000MB/s write, so I wish they spent a bit more effort to provide the proper information on their packaging material.\n\nPerformance:\nI put the drive through its paces using an external USB-C NVMe enclosure as well as in a computer and running benchmarks using CrystalDiskMark8 as well copying files to and from the drive.\n\nUSB-C NVMe Enclosure:\n- CrystalDiskMark: Read = 1050.79MB/s and Write = 950.84MB/s.\n- Windows Write: Writing a 12.7GB file into the drive took 34.28secs = 370.48MB/s Write speed.\n- Windows Read: Copying out the same 12.7GB file took 37.4secs = 339.57MB/s Read speed.\n- Windows Write (small files): Writing 5.98GB of smaller multiple files ranging from a few hundred megs to 1GB into the drive took 67.24secs = 88.94MB/s.\no This was exceptionally slow as the peak speed was 54MB/s, but subsequent copy of the same data files were able to copy at 389MB/s.\n- Windows Read (small files): Copying the same 5.98GB of files out of the drive onto my laptop took 60.95secs = 98MB/s Read speeds.\no Recopying the same files out took only 16.31secs = 366MB/s\n\nDuring the speed tests, it seems on initial write & read of multiple smaller files the drive seems to struggle with the throughput as you can see it spike upwards and then slows down and then keeps repeating, so the transfer graph is very jagged. Subsequent copies of the same files into and out of the drive seems to work as it’s supposed to. Not sure if there’s a caching issue or if there was some other factor causing the slowness.\n\nHP Laptop Install:\nTo eliminate the USB port or enclosure as the speed limiting factor, I installed it into my laptop and installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 and reran the CrystalDiskMark tests and was pleasantly surprised that the max Read speed was 2360.39MB/s & the Write was 1200.26MB/s. The Read speeds jumped over 2X and the write speed up 25%.\n\nI couldn’t run the Windows copy as the laptop only had one drive and it wouldn’t be a proper test to copy from itself into itself.\n\nOverall, I found the LinkMore XE200 256GB PCIe NVMe 2280 M.2 drive performed very well. In an external enclosure, it performed OK, but that performance quickly jumped and exceeded its advertised specs on the manufacturer’s website datasheet specs when directly installed in a computer. The drive is actually faster than the original drive that came with the HP laptop and now is the permanent drive for the unit."

        "review": "I won't spend a load of time and words going into reams of specs that are available in more detail from the seller. What I found is that this low-cost drive has so far performed almost as well as the higher priced big brand names. The only thing I can't comment on is how well it works over time compared to the other brands.\n👀 The only spec I will include is a screenshot of the write speed when first used in an external 10Gb USB C enclosure before installing it in the PC. While not as fast as brand name drives, this is plenty fast for most applications. It is faster than most users would need a drive to be. Boot time and shutdown are measured in seconds.\n» Pricing is in the ballpark with other after market brand drives of the same capacity.\n\nWould I recommend this for a gamer, someone that uses photo/video editing applications, or someone who doesn't back up their important items? No, not yet. It will need to prove itself over time, and no amount of testing with Crystal mark or other performance software can provide that detail. For the average user that does back up their important items, it's a great way to upgrade an older laptop or add a second drive to a PC if the MoBo has space. If there are any problems down the road, I will follow up.\n\nI have had it running on a PC as the OS drive that's been in operation 24/7 for the last four weeks. I'm using it to run a game server for some friends and which means there are a lot of writes, so this is a great test. It was installed with no issues, and both Windows 11 and Windows Server 2019 were installed without the need for any drivers. I tested it on Windows 11 but then installed Server 2019 for stability. Other than restarts due to updates, the machine has never gone down. It does have a decent heat sink on it and runs no hotter than the big brand name drives.\n\nDo I have enough confidence that if I needed another drive, I would get a second one of these, yes. I will need a 1TB NVMe drive in a couple of months for a new build, and considering the performance is very good, and the drive is 35% of what I would pay for a brand name, yes, I'll save some money and order a LinkMore."

If you are looking for something that's a significant upgrade to your existing/old SSD and in need of a budget drive as your system drive to speed up initial boot time, then perhaps give this a shot.\n\nThis is another one of those non-brand name NVMe SSDs that I've never heard of but it claims to be made in Taiwan which is much more desirable (if you build your own computers from parts especially in the 90's, then you know what I'm talking about); however, I see no indication that this is actually made in Taiwan so I'm not sure what to think of that at the moment.\n\nWith that being said, its performance is actually quite good considering its price.\n\nRead: 2183 MB/s\nWrite: 1089 MB/s\n\nBoth its read and write speeds appear to be slightly higher than what's being advertised here 2000/1000 MB/s); however, it claims a much higher throughput (2500/2100 MB/s) from the box it comes with. Though, it does mention the speed varies and depends up capacity which is often the case for any flash-based devices including USB drives and NVMe/SATA SSD drives.\n\nIt's using Phison PS5013-E13-31 SSD controller which does NOT include DRAM cache which is one of the reasons that this is a budget NVMe SSD. Well, you get what you pay for and it's a reasonably trade-off if you are short on budget.\n\nAll things considered, this is a fairly decent budget NVMe SSD that's well-performed and it's reasonably priced at $34 for 256GB. It's a great upgrade for ordinary SATA SSD (assuming your MB supports and/or has the slot for it) and you WILL see noticeable performance boost in in comparison to SATA SSDs."

        "review": "Reliability of SSDs has been sketchy since 2021. Samsung is no exception and they have one of the worst RMA service ever in Canada. In this context, I chose the next best with a decent RMA service in Canada: Western Digital.\nSo far, I am quite happy with my purchase. It came in perfect health and is still at perfect health after cloning my old Toshiba HDD on it. So far, so good. My SSD is of the newest generation and was manufactured May 23rd 2023. Speed is as advertised. My computer gets to the log in screen much faster and all the background apps load super fast. Games are impacted too, of course. Initial game launch, loading saved games and loading between levels takes half the time it used to take with my old 7200 rpm HDD. Even the graphics are impacted because textures load much quicker.\nOne thing I am not so sure about, though, is the Acronis True Image software that is provided. It is rather clunky and people have had problems cloning with it (errors, having to wipe the SSD and try again), so I decided not to use it, especially after I saw that it would hang for over a minute just when I clicked to bring up the cloning tool. That is NOT normal. If it hangs so much on that step, imagine how it will struggle when doing the actual cloning. I wanted to go with the free version of AOMEI, but apparently they have put their cloning tool behind a paywall. I ended up using Macrium True Reflect (free trial), but there are plenty others which would have done just as nicely. I was able to adjust my partitions exactly to my liking.\nI hope I got one of the reliable ones and that it will not fail before several years. I will update my review if anything happens."

Mi experiencia con estos productos es muy buena, ya que siempre los compro si hay en estado \"como nuevo\" y \"muy bueno\". Realmente vienen con algún desperfecto en la caja original y poco más.

Lo mejor de todo es que siempre me ahorro un buen dinero.\n\nVoviendo al tema del disco duro... He de decir que no pesa mucho, es muy liviano.\n\nLa verdad es que es buena marca y tengo buena experiencia con estos discos duros.\n\nLa velocidad de cargar el sistema operativo es buena, bastante rápida.

Nun hat sich im Laufe der Zeit so viel Hardware aus dem \"alten PC\" angesammelt, so dass ich mir daraus einen zweiten PC basteln konnte. Da ich auch dort meine Steam Games haben wollte, brauchte ich natürlich ein entsprechendes Datengrab. Leider bin ich so blöd gewesen und hatte mir auf Grund des damals niedrigen Preis eine BX500 von Crucial gekauft. Hätte ich mich besser vorher belesen, was ich eigentlich immer tue, bevor ich irgend eine Hardware kaufe, wäre mir der Fehler erspart geblieben. Denn die Crucial BX 500 mit 2 TB hat keinen eigenen DRAM Cache und der Speicher besteht wohl bei den großen Modellen aus QLC Speicher, was ich überhaupt nicht mag! Leseraten waren einigermaßen ok, aber die Schreibraten brachen beim Schreiben großer Dateien nach schon kurzer Zeit bis auf 27 MB/s ein! Das geht für eine SSD, die am Sata Port schreibend eigentlich so um die 530 MB/s schaffen könnte, gar nicht. Inzwischen sind die Preise auch für Sata SSD's der größeren Speicherkapazität im Preis gesunken und sah bei Amazon meine Lieblings SSD von WD für nur 99,90 Euronen. Ohne weiter nachzudenken habe ich mir diese bestellt, eingebaut, Spiele wieder drauf gepackt und .....Läuft! Datenraten sind am Sata Port absolut im grünen Bereich. Schreibrate ca. 530 MB/s und Leserate ca. 540 MB/s und das dauerhaft, ohne Einbrüche. Daher klare Kaufempfehlung meinerseits."

        "review": "Cloned my old boot SSD to this one after a lot of difficulty but in the process connected and disconnected it a lot and it still works fine. You will need to buy a ssd tray to mount in your case If your computer doesn't have one included as most are made for the bigger hdd. Will need mounting screws but most trays have them included. Also Sata and power cables too.\n\nCloning a Boot drive:\nI'm just including this part incase you run into the same problems I did because none of the online solutions I found worked. I used this for Windows 7 with Macrium Reflect so it might work differently on Windows 10 with another software. I'm not an IT guy just someone who likes to mess around with computers so no guarantees it works for you but It did for me. If you don't already have a cloning software you can download Macrium Reflect it is free.\n\n1) Connect the new drive and go into the windows search bar and search for Run and then enter diskmgmt.msc, it should show all the drives and you can find the one you just connected and if it isn't popping up in my computer you can see if it has been given a letter like C drive. If not right click and give it a letter. Sometimes the old boot drive will have 2 partitions. One labeled System Reserved and a regular one. Both will cloned but sometimes all are include in one partition. If you look in diskmgmt it will say Active, Boot, Crash Dump,etc. Under the partition that is used to Boot from.\n\n2) After that is done open up the cloning program and clone. Once that is done go back into diskmgmt and right click on the partition to mark it as active. Now this is where it goes wrong sometimes. Turn off the computer and disconnect the old drive and when the computer starts look for which key you have to press to enter the Bios or Uefi settings so you can change the boot order. Sometimes the computer will just go through every drive by default but it's better if you go and find the drive you want it to boot from first which will be your new ssd. Now hopefully it works and starts and everything is good. If not like on mine you will have to move on to the next step.\n\nNow my problem was not because it was a bad boot record or file system compatibility issue. I tried all of those and there are guides for that. But my problem was that Windows would only recognize the System reserved on my new drive as being the place to boot from but not the regular partition. It would still only boot from the old partition on my old drive because it was labeled as Boot, Crash Dump etc. Marking it as Active didn't help because as far as I could figure out those labels were only placed when Windows was installed on the system and even without the old drive connected diskmgmt would not label it so.\n\n1) You will need a Windows install USB or disc. If you don't have one you can try making a recovery disc from your old drive but I have not tried that way so I'm not sure if it will work. If that doesn't work try and find a torrent for your version of Windows. Don't worry about getting a product key or installing a crack you just need it to install Windows. Once you clone it will go back to your original install.\n\n2) Format the new SSD. You may have to go unmark it as Active and switch the boot order back so that it will boot off your old drive. If like mine and it only recognized the System reserved on the new ssd it won't let you format until it goes back to recognizing the old drive. You may have to restart after marking it as inactive. Once you do that and format get a usb and download a program that will search for drivers as a clean install of windows might not have drivers and not let you connect to the internet. You can find one or if you want go to Windows on your old drive from my computer and look for Program files and copy the Macrium folder. Inside there should be a Application that is named Reflect and will launch the program without having to download on the new drive. If you used another program just put the install files into the USB.\n\n3) Once formatted and you have the files on a USB disconnect all the drives except your new one and put in the Windows install CD or USB and install it on the drive. Once that is done and your on the windows homepage turn off the computer and plug in the old boot drive and see if it's boots to the new install of windows. If it doesn't fix the boot order.\n\n4) Now open the cloning software and try cloning to the new drive now from the old one. If you are using Macrium it should say something about it can't do it and will need to restart and use Windows PE environment. Say yes and let it restart. It has to do this because unlike before where you tried cloning from the working drive to the new one now you are cloning to the working drive and it can't run windows and rewrite it at the same time. Let it load and then open the cloning software again and now it should clone and the partition will have the right labels as it was already marked so from it installing windows and all your old files should be there. If everything works now you should see that only the cloned part of the drive is popping up on my computer and all the extra space is unallocated in diskmgmt. Right click on the regular partition if your has 2 and choose to extend volume. Keep clicking yes and the extra space will be added.\n\nSorry if this isn't as clear and concise as I would have liked but I found a lot of people with a similar problem after cloning a Boot drive and none of the articles or forums helped."

        "review": "Reliability of SSDs has been sketchy since 2021. Samsung is no exception and they have one of the worst RMA service ever in Canada. In this context, I chose the next best with a decent RMA service in Canada: Western Digital.\nSo far, I am quite happy with my purchase. It came in perfect health and is still at perfect health after cloning my old Toshiba HDD on it. So far, so good. My SSD is of the newest generation and was manufactured May 23rd 2023. Speed is as advertised. My computer gets to the log in screen much faster and all the background apps load super fast. Games are impacted too, of course. Initial game launch, loading saved games and loading between levels takes half the time it used to take with my old 7200 rpm HDD. Even the graphics are impacted because textures load much quicker.\nOne thing I am not so sure about, though, is the Acronis True Image software that is provided. It is rather clunky and people have had problems cloning with it (errors, having to wipe the SSD and try again), so I decided not to use it, especially after I saw that it would hang for over a minute just when I clicked to bring up the cloning tool. That is NOT normal. If it hangs so much on that step, imagine how it will struggle when doing the actual cloning. I wanted to go with the free version of AOMEI, but apparently they have put their cloning tool behind a paywall. I ended up using Macrium True Reflect (free trial), but there are plenty others which would have done just as nicely. I was able to adjust my partitions exactly to my liking.\nI hope I got one of the reliable ones and that it will not fail before several years. I will update my review if anything happens."

Mi experiencia con estos productos es muy buena, ya que siempre los compro si hay en estado \"como nuevo\" y \"muy bueno\". Realmente vienen con algún desperfecto en la caja original y poco más. Algo que no me importa, es recibir la caja un poco doblada o rota por algún lado. Ya que el interior está bien y no afecta en su funcionamiento y muchísimas veces no son usados. Lo mejor de todo es que siempre me ahorro un buen dinero.\n\nVoviendo al tema del disco duro... He de decir que no pesa mucho, es muy liviano.\n\nLa verdad es que es buena marca y tengo buena experiencia con estos discos duros.\n\nLa velocidad de cargar el sistema operativo es buena, bastante rápida.

Nun hat sich im Laufe der Zeit so viel Hardware aus dem \"alten PC\" angesammelt, so dass ich mir daraus einen zweiten PC basteln konnte. Da ich auch dort meine Steam Games haben wollte, brauchte ich natürlich ein entsprechendes Datengrab. Leider bin ich so blöd gewesen und hatte mir auf Grund des damals niedrigen Preis eine BX500 von Crucial gekauft. Hätte ich mich besser vorher belesen, was ich eigentlich immer tue, bevor ich irgend eine Hardware kaufe, wäre mir der Fehler erspart geblieben. Denn die Crucial BX 500 mit 2 TB hat keinen eigenen DRAM Cache und der Speicher besteht wohl bei den großen Modellen aus QLC Speicher, was ich überhaupt nicht mag! Leseraten waren einigermaßen ok, aber die Schreibraten brachen beim Schreiben großer Dateien nach schon kurzer Zeit bis auf 27 MB/s ein! Das geht für eine SSD, die am Sata Port schreibend eigentlich so um die 530 MB/s schaffen könnte, gar nicht. Inzwischen sind die Preise auch für Sata SSD's der größeren Speicherkapazität im Preis gesunken und sah bei Amazon meine Lieblings SSD von WD für nur 99,90 Euronen. Ohne weiter nachzudenken habe ich mir diese bestellt, eingebaut, Spiele wieder drauf gepackt und .....Läuft! Datenraten sind am Sata Port absolut im grünen Bereich. Schreibrate ca. 530 MB/s und Leserate ca. 540 MB/s und das dauerhaft, ohne Einbrüche. Daher klare Kaufempfehlung meinerseits."

        "review": "Cloned my old boot SSD to this one after a lot of difficulty but in the process connected and disconnected it a lot and it still works fine. You will need to buy a ssd tray to mount in your case If your computer doesn't have one included as most are made for the bigger hdd. Will need mounting screws but most trays have them included. Also Sata and power cables too.\n\nCloning a Boot drive:\nI'm just including this part incase you run into the same problems I did because none of the online solutions I found worked. I used this for Windows 7 with Macrium Reflect so it might work differently on Windows 10 with another software. I'm not an IT guy just someone who likes to mess around with computers so no guarantees it works for you but It did for me. If you don't already have a cloning software you can download Macrium Reflect it is free.\n\n1) Connect the new drive and go into the windows search bar and search for Run and then enter diskmgmt.msc, it should show all the drives and you can find the one you just connected and if it isn't popping up in my computer you can see if it has been given a letter like C drive. If not right click and give it a letter. Sometimes the old boot drive will have 2 partitions. One labeled System Reserved and a regular one. Both will cloned but sometimes all are include in one partition. If you look in diskmgmt it will say Active, Boot, Crash Dump,etc. Under the partition that is used to Boot from.\n\n2) After that is done open up the cloning program and clone. Once that is done go back into diskmgmt and right click on the partition to mark it as active. Now this is where it goes wrong sometimes. Turn off the computer and disconnect the old drive and when the computer starts look for which key you have to press to enter the Bios or Uefi settings so you can change the boot order. Sometimes the computer will just go through every drive by default but it's better if you go and find the drive you want it to boot from first which will be your new ssd. Now hopefully it works and starts and everything is good. If not like on mine you will have to move on to the next step.\n\nNow my problem was not because it was a bad boot record or file system compatibility issue. I tried all of those and there are guides for that. But my problem was that Windows would only recognize the System reserved on my new drive as being the place to boot from but not the regular partition. It would still only boot from the old partition on my old drive because it was labeled as Boot, Crash Dump etc. Marking it as Active didn't help because as far as I could figure out those labels were only placed when Windows was installed on the system and even without the old drive connected diskmgmt would not label it so.\n\n1) You will need a Windows install USB or disc. If you don't have one you can try making a recovery disc from your old drive but I have not tried that way so I'm not sure if it will work. If that doesn't work try and find a torrent for your version of Windows. Don't worry about getting a product key or installing a crack you just need it to install Windows. Once you clone it will go back to your original install.\n\n2) Format the new SSD. You may have to go unmark it as Active and switch the boot order back so that it will boot off your old drive. If like mine and it only recognized the System reserved on the new ssd it won't let you format until it goes back to recognizing the old drive. You may have to restart after marking it as inactive. Once you do that and format get a usb and download a program that will search for drivers as a clean install of windows might not have drivers and not let you connect to the internet. You can find one or if you want go to Windows on your old drive from my computer and look for Program files and copy the Macrium folder. Inside there should be a Application that is named Reflect and will launch the program without having to download on the new drive. If you used another program just put the install files into the USB.\n\n3) Once formatted and you have the files on a USB disconnect all the drives except your new one and put in the Windows install CD or USB and install it on the drive. Once that is done and your on the windows homepage turn off the computer and plug in the old boot drive and see if it's boots to the new install of windows. If it doesn't fix the boot order.\n\n4) Now open the cloning software and try cloning to the new drive now from the old one. If you are using Macrium it should say something about it can't do it and will need to restart and use Windows PE environment. Say yes and let it restart. It has to do this because unlike before where you tried cloning from the working drive to the new one now you are cloning to the working drive and it can't run windows and rewrite it at the same time. Let it load and then open the cloning software again and now it should clone and the partition will have the right labels as it was already marked so from it installing windows and all your old files should be there. If everything works now you should see that only the cloned part of the drive is popping up on my computer and all the extra space is unallocated in diskmgmt. Right click on the regular partition if your has 2 and choose to extend volume. Keep clicking yes and the extra space will be added.\n\nSorry if this isn't as clear and concise as I would have liked but I found a lot of people with a similar problem after cloning a Boot drive and none of the articles or forums helped."

        "review": "Reliability of SSDs has been sketchy since 2021. Samsung is no exception and they have one of the worst RMA service ever in Canada. In this context, I chose the next best with a decent RMA service in Canada: Western Digital.\nSo far, I am quite happy with my purchase. It came in perfect health and is still at perfect health after cloning my old Toshiba HDD on it. So far, so good. My SSD is of the newest generation and was manufactured May 23rd 2023. Speed is as advertised. My computer gets to the log in screen much faster and all the background apps load super fast. Games are impacted too, of course. Initial game launch, loading saved games and loading between levels takes half the time it used to take with my old 7200 rpm HDD. Even the graphics are impacted because textures load much quicker.\nOne thing I am not so sure about, though, is the Acronis True Image software that is provided. It is rather clunky and people have had problems cloning with it (errors, having to wipe the SSD and try again), so I decided not to use it, especially after I saw that it would hang for over a minute just when I clicked to bring up the cloning tool. That is NOT normal. If it hangs so much on that step, imagine how it will struggle when doing the actual cloning. I wanted to go with the free version of AOMEI, but apparently they have put their cloning tool behind a paywall. I ended up using Macrium True Reflect (free trial), but there are plenty others which would have done just as nicely. I was able to adjust my partitions exactly to my liking.\nI hope I got one of the reliable ones and that it will not fail before several years. I will update my review if anything happens."

Porque dentro de la torre no sufre golpes ni nada por el estilo.\n\nEs más... dentro está seguro y bien ventilado. Va sujeto con sus 4 tornillos.\n\nAntes de que me falle el sistema y pierda mis archivos decidí comprar uno y jubilar mi antiguo disco que es de la misma marca.\n\nMe lancé por un producto de segunda mano. Mi experiencia con estos productos es muy buena, ya que siempre los compro si hay en estado \"como nuevo\" y \"muy bueno\". Realmente vienen con algún desperfecto en la caja original y poco más. Algo que no me importa, es recibir la caja un poco doblada o rota por algún lado. Ya que el interior está bien y no afecta en su funcionamiento y muchísimas veces no son usados. Lo mejor de todo es que siempre me ahorro un buen dinero.\n\nVoviendo al tema del disco duro... He de decir que no pesa mucho, es muy liviano.\n\nLa verdad es que es buena marca y tengo buena experiencia con estos discos duros.\n\nLa velocidad de cargar el sistema operativo es buena, bastante rápida. El abrir carpetas y demás también. Todo muy fluido.\n\nEspero que me dure otros 7 años como me duró el otro disco duro. Recomiendo la marca y estos modelos en sí."

        "review": "Die WD Blue Sata SSD mit 2 TB Kapazität ist eine schnelle und zuverlässige SSD für den Sata Port.\nIch nutze dieses Modell bereits in einem Gaming PC seit mehreren Jahren und der Status ist laut CrystalDiskInfo immer noch bei 100%. Nun hat sich im Laufe der Zeit so viel Hardware aus dem \"alten PC\" angesammelt, so dass ich mir daraus einen zweiten PC basteln konnte. Da ich auch dort meine Steam Games haben wollte, brauchte ich natürlich ein entsprechendes Datengrab. Leider bin ich so blöd gewesen und hatte mir auf Grund des damals niedrigen Preis eine BX500 von Crucial gekauft. Hätte ich mich besser vorher belesen, was ich eigentlich immer tue, bevor ich irgend eine Hardware kaufe, wäre mir der Fehler erspart geblieben. Denn die Crucial BX 500 mit 2 TB hat keinen eigenen DRAM Cache und der Speicher besteht wohl bei den großen Modellen aus QLC Speicher, was ich überhaupt nicht mag! Leseraten waren einigermaßen ok, aber die Schreibraten brachen beim Schreiben großer Dateien nach schon kurzer Zeit bis auf 27 MB/s ein! Das geht für eine SSD, die am Sata Port schreibend eigentlich so um die 530 MB/s schaffen könnte, gar nicht. Inzwischen sind die Preise auch für Sata SSD's der größeren Speicherkapazität im Preis gesunken und sah bei Amazon meine Lieblings SSD von WD für nur 99,90 Euronen. Ohne weiter nachzudenken habe ich mir diese bestellt, eingebaut, Spiele wieder drauf gepackt und .....Läuft! Datenraten sind am Sata Port absolut im grünen Bereich. Schreibrate ca. 530 MB/s und Leserate ca. 540 MB/s und das dauerhaft, ohne Einbrüche. Daher klare Kaufempfehlung meinerseits."

        "review": "Cloned my old boot SSD to this one after a lot of difficulty but in the process connected and disconnected it a lot and it still works fine. You will need to buy a ssd tray to mount in your case If your computer doesn't have one included as most are made for the bigger hdd. Will need mounting screws but most trays have them included. Also Sata and power cables too.\n\nCloning a Boot drive:\nI'm just including this part incase you run into the same problems I did because none of the online solutions I found worked. I used this for Windows 7 with Macrium Reflect so it might work differently on Windows 10 with another software. I'm not an IT guy just someone who likes to mess around with computers so no guarantees it works for you but It did for me. If you don't already have a cloning software you can download Macrium Reflect it is free.\n\n1) Connect the new drive and go into the windows search bar and search for Run and then enter diskmgmt.msc, it should show all the drives and you can find the one you just connected and if it isn't popping up in my computer you can see if it has been given a letter like C drive. If not right click and give it a letter. Sometimes the old boot drive will have 2 partitions. One labeled System Reserved and a regular one. Both will cloned but sometimes all are include in one partition. If you look in diskmgmt it will say Active, Boot, Crash Dump,etc. Under the partition that is used to Boot from.\n\n2) After that is done open up the cloning program and clone. Once that is done go back into diskmgmt and right click on the partition to mark it as active. Now this is where it goes wrong sometimes. Turn off the computer and disconnect the old drive and when the computer starts look for which key you have to press to enter the Bios or Uefi settings so you can change the boot order. Sometimes the computer will just go through every drive by default but it's better if you go and find the drive you want it to boot from first which will be your new ssd. Now hopefully it works and starts and everything is good. If not like on mine you will have to move on to the next step.\n\nNow my problem was not because it was a bad boot record or file system compatibility issue. I tried all of those and there are guides for that. But my problem was that Windows would only recognize the System reserved on my new drive as being the place to boot from but not the regular partition. It would still only boot from the old partition on my old drive because it was labeled as Boot, Crash Dump etc. Marking it as Active didn't help because as far as I could figure out those labels were only placed when Windows was installed on the system and even without the old drive connected diskmgmt would not label it so.\n\n1) You will need a Windows install USB or disc. If you don't have one you can try making a recovery disc from your old drive but I have not tried that way so I'm not sure if it will work. If that doesn't work try and find a torrent for your version of Windows. Don't worry about getting a product key or installing a crack you just need it to install Windows. Once you clone it will go back to your original install.\n\n2) Format the new SSD. You may have to go unmark it as Active and switch the boot order back so that it will boot off your old drive. If like mine and it only recognized the System reserved on the new ssd it won't let you format until it goes back to recognizing the old drive. You may have to restart after marking it as inactive. Once you do that and format get a usb and download a program that will search for drivers as a clean install of windows might not have drivers and not let you connect to the internet. You can find one or if you want go to Windows on your old drive from my computer and look for Program files and copy the Macrium folder. Inside there should be a Application that is named Reflect and will launch the program without having to download on the new drive. If you used another program just put the install files into the USB.\n\n3) Once formatted and you have the files on a USB disconnect all the drives except your new one and put in the Windows install CD or USB and install it on the drive. Once that is done and your on the windows homepage turn off the computer and plug in the old boot drive and see if it's boots to the new install of windows. If it doesn't fix the boot order.\n\n4) Now open the cloning software and try cloning to the new drive now from the old one. If you are using Macrium it should say something about it can't do it and will need to restart and use Windows PE environment. Say yes and let it restart. It has to do this because unlike before where you tried cloning from the working drive to the new one now you are cloning to the working drive and it can't run windows and rewrite it at the same time. Let it load and then open the cloning software again and now it should clone and the partition will have the right labels as it was already marked so from it installing windows and all your old files should be there. If everything works now you should see that only the cloned part of the drive is popping up on my computer and all the extra space is unallocated in diskmgmt. Right click on the regular partition if your has 2 and choose to extend volume. Keep clicking yes and the extra space will be added.\n\nSorry if this isn't as clear and concise as I would have liked but I found a lot of people with a similar problem after cloning a Boot drive and none of the articles or forums helped."

        "review": "This drive works very well and has a decent speed.\nOne unforseen problem I ran into however was I could not reinstall Windows 11 on this drive because that requires a full 64GB minimum, and after formatting the capacity goes down just below 64GB so the Windows install complains that the drive is too small and will not proceed with the installation. That's a shame because it's a nice SSD. For regular storage though it's great, such as in an external enclosure.\nIf you intend to install Windows 11 though I would recommend getting a 128GB SSD or larger SSD as Windows 11 should install with that ok. I ended up getting a 512GB SSD and it went smoothly.\nThis could be a problem with Windows 10 also but I have not tried that. It could also be that it depends on the actual Windows 11 build, but I have read that the most recent versions have this requirement in order to install. It's kind of ironic that the requirement is 64GB yet when you buy a 64GB drive it doesn't install because of a tiny difference of about 2 or 3GB which means it reports to the Windows install program that it is smaller than 64GB.\nGood luck to you."

Doesn't have rubber grommets around the wire holes but that is ok for the price, you could go up 30-40$ in case tiers to get those if they are important to you. Remember to remove the PCIe slot covers you will need open from the case before inserting the motherboard.\n\nThe case is visually nice as well, the white and black design looks good with a variety of component colors on the inside, you should be able to match almost anything with it.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the case did not come with a little screw bit to help put the motherboard stand offs in. Personally this does not matter to me as I have them already and other screw bits in my set. But for someone missing it, it does make inserting the standoffs straight a bit more difficult, Although it can be done by hand if needed, it will just be a bit more frustrating to do.\n\nA decent case."

It'll get the job done, but at $109 its overpriced. I know, that's the world we live in now.\n\nI was getting an old P.C back from my son that I had built him in 2016 and I didn't realize he was sending the case back with the other components. The case from 2016 was a cooler master and when I compared these 2 cases (the original build and this case I ordered), they are virtually identical. I paid $30 in 2016 for that other case.\n\nHad I known he was shipping the case back I would have saved the $109 on this one as it was no upgrade whatsoever (maybe a little cleaner). The old case has two usb 3.1 ports on the top of the case. This case only has one 3.1 port.\n\nOh and if you don't like green lights on your fans or it doesn't jive with your build don't order this as the lights aren't adjustable."

        "review": "For a relatively unknown brand (at least here in North America), this SSD performs pretty well at an incredibly affordable price. While it won't outperform the best from the bigger, reputable companies like Samsung and Western Digital, it will be a significant step up from the archaic mechanical HDDs that take minutes to do even the most basic tasks.\n\nNOTE: I am using this with a USB 3.0 connector cable (often used for cloning hard drives), so read and write speeds will probably be faster if you plug this straight into your PC's SATA connection.\n\nRunning on Window's 11, it wouldn't immediately show up for me (probably because of my cable), so I went into Settings > Storage > Manage Storage Spaces, and then clicked \"INITALIZE\", which brought it online. I then proceeded to format the SSD to the NTFS format with the max available capacity (just over 119GB). I did a basic test of moving a few large and small files (i.e., school documents, movies and TV shows, etc.), and it managed to move all of it pretty quickly (taking only a few seconds to move the smaller files and about 2 minutes to make a 11-episode anime series).\n\nThe form fact it's pretty much standard for something like this; hard plastic shell and pretty lightweight since there's no moving mechanical parts inisde it. The brand's iconic red design does give it some visual flare, which might look cool inside you tower PC or a transparent external SSD enclosure (which I might get for this). Being a SATA III SSD, I wasn't expecting to to be as fast as the M.2 NVMe drives that are installed directly into my PC, but I do think that it will be plenty fast for most people's real-world applications, but maybe a little hesitant to play games off this since I cannot determine if this SSD has any proper thermal management inside it to sustain longer loads often associated with gaming.\n\nLong-term reliability is relatively unknown; unlike Samsung, WD, or SK Hynix, this brand nor this company doesn't have an established reputation in North America yet (might be a bigger name in China and Asian markets), so there's no existing data or statistics to properly judge how long this will perform without an issues down the line. Given the current nature of mid- to low-priced SSDs, I would assume it will last for quite a while, and the 3 year limited warranty is a bit reassuring for consumers."

But, still, I am a bit hesitant trusting a no-name drive in a single drive usage scenarios, so I use this mirrored with another drive. This way, if the SSD flakes out, my data is going to remain intact.\n\nSo, this works well for an inexpensive SSD drive, but reliability is to be determined by long term use."

So far, only a Sedna 4-port USB 3.0 card has worked well with a single Fresco Logic FL1100, but I wanted more ports. This one, as well as a Vantech Quad-Chip 4-port USB 3.0 PCIe card both have pretty bad results with the interface. No amount of tweaking lead to any measurable improvement.\nThis might stem from their \"multi-chip\" design. This one has 2 chips, where I believe the FL1100 chip is actually a slave to a Renasas controller that's controlling the USB-C ports. I don't know if this effectively makes it so that the USB audio is connected to a \"hub\" or what, but getting the krispies ain't gonna work out for me. When using the card on bare metal, there are no problems with the interface and it works great -- so 4 stars.\nNext controller I will try is the newest Inateck 3.2 Gen 2 6+2 port controller with an ASMedia chipset, but so far I think I might just have to go back to the Sedna card. Not sure what I'm going to do with all these spares..."

Nothing wrong with that! When my computer stopped turning on, I could have bought a whole new computer. Instead, I tried replacing expensive computer parts that weren't the problem -- the CPU, motherboard, power supply. Turned out to be the \"On\" button that broke. Since that's built into my computer case, I had to get funky with a screwdriver and take the case apart. This kit was the easiest way to replace the little electric switch that the big fancy button built into my case actually pushes. Kit comes with a \"power\" switch, a \"reset\" switch, and LEDs for \"power\" and \"HDD\". These \"momentary on\" switches merely connect the two leads while pressed. As you can see, the \"power\" and \"HDD\" LEDs are different colors. You don't have to use every one of the switches and LEDs -- just zip off the ones you don't want. 2 kits for $6 is 50x cheaper than a $150 computer case."

        "review": "This is a solid, well built budget rack mount server chassis. It's important to understand what you're getting here. So long as your expectations are appropriate, these chassis offer excellent value.\n\nFirst off, these are no SuperMicro. The target market is not enterprise companies. If you want a complete SYSTEM - and by that I mean, chassis, rails, etc. that all work together seamlessly - look elsewhere. But if you are willing to overlook a few potential warts, this is a great value.\n\nNow, let's first clarify some typical, appropriate use cases for this chassis. For starters, I bought the RSV-4500. This chassis comes with 8 fans and holds up to 15 3.5\" hard drives. The hard drive caddies are up front, and mean there's air being pushed across them, and then air is pulled across them as well by the next set of fans, located about 1/3 deep into the case (measured front to back). The distance between both sets of fans is ~9\". This leads me to suspect this amount of cooling is overkill for most disks, even with 5 of them per cage / per set of fans. The fans are 120mm.\n\nThere is a sister case, which is Rosewill model RSV-L4412U. The only difference between them is the RSV-L4412U model has 12 hot swap bays and is missing the 3 front-most 120mm fans found in the RSV-4500. The hot swap bays provided with the RSV-L4412U model are 3x RSV-SATA-Cage-34, a 4-bay 3.5\" drive cage made of plastic and have some questionable design characteristics. They retail on Amazon for ~$80 each + tax.\n\nIf a budget hot-swap rackmount chassis is your goal, the RSV-L4412U is an incredible bargain. If you were to purchase the RSV-4500 for example, and then purchase 3x of the Rosewill drive cages, you would spend substantially more money than if you simply bought the RSV-L4412U in the first place.\n\nIf you are more interested in getting the best overall combination of number of 3.5\" hard drives, hot swap drive capability, and a good quality chassis, you are better off going with the RSV-4500 and separately purchasing 3x 3.5\" drive cages manufactured by Norco or SuperMicro. Several independent tests have shown these drive cages to be among the best at keeping 3.5\" drives reasonably cool. Avoid Icy Dock. iStarUSA used to produce good quality drive cages, but their current offerings are either flimsy and/or have poor drive cooling, and should also be avoided if you would like to ensure your drives don't fail prematurely due to constant overheating.\n\nThere is one other option for a 15-drive bay setup. That is to go with the RSV-4500, not purchase hot swap drive cages, but remove the front fans. In this configuration, you still take advantage of the air filter built into the front of the flip down case fascia, and it is possible to position the drive inserts that come with the RSV-4500 case such that your SATA/SAS connection is facing rearward, while the clips to remove a drive and replace it when necessary are pointed forward. This will allow you to close the fascia and hide your bare drives, but access them easily when necessary. This approach is not for everyone, but it is a budget-conscious solution that will provide you with up to 15-drive bays in a well-cooled chassis, in spite of removing the front fans. With your drives installed in this manner, they will still be ~4\" from the 3x 120mm fans still installed in the case. For most people, with most hard drives, this will be more than adequate air flow to keep your drives reasonably cool.\n\nTo re-cap, there are several options for installing a good sized bank of 3.5\" drives in this case, and its design offers considerable flexibility.\n\nOne area that is a negative, is the documentation for the chassis is mediocre at best, and poor in some respects. For example, it fails to explain the fact that in order to depress the tabs that release the incumbent hard drive cages in the RSV-4500, you must first remove 1 or 2 screws for each cage that holds it in place. Once you have done so, the act of removing the drive cages requires one to simultaneously push down a couple of metal tabs on top of the drive cage, and apply force from the rear of the drive cage pushing it forward. Then, it will release out the front of the case. Furthermore, these acts require the removal (or at least sliding back) the top case cover. This latter point is noteworthy if you plan to install the chassis in a server rack and anything is installed directly above it. This, in turn leads me to my final point; the rails.\n\nI purchased the set of rails manufactured by Rosewill and compatible with this case. These rails are not included with your purchase of the chassis, which is a common issue with budget rackmount chassis.\n\nUnfortunately, the Rosewill rails use an old, rudimentary design that has fallen out of favor with most large, mainstream server chassis manufacturers, and for good reason. There are a lot of variety of server racks on the market now, and I found the Rosewill rail system would not install properly on my wall-mount server rack from StarTech. Specifically, the outer rail - where it wraps around the front and rear of a 4-post rack - was 1/8\" too wide. This resulted in a narrowing of the space between both inner rails of 1/4\", which was enough to make it impossible to install the Rosewill RSV-L4500 chassis in the server rack after attaching the inner rails to it and attempting to connect it with the middle rails on the rail system. Careful investigation after it became clear the unit was not going to fit into the rack revealed the flaw in the design of the Rosewill rails.\n\nI then experimented with a set of 3U/4U SuperMicro rails that use a more modern rail design, but I ran into the opposite problem. This combination resulted in an extra gap between the sides of the RSV-L4500 and the outer rails attached securely to the rack. I could have attempted the use of 5mm spacers, but this would have made the process more complicated by requiring 5mm longer screws. Furthermore, the rail screw holes in the SuperMicro inner rail did not align well with the side of the RSV-L4500 and it's pre-drilled rack rail mounting holes, meaning it would have been necessary to tap drill out multiple new threaded holes in the case for the purpose of utilizing the SuperMicro rail. In short, the LSV-4500 does not lend itself to universal rails (I also tried a set of StarTech rails, which also had alignment issues), due to the uncommon width of the server (it is rather narrow at 16.8\" wide). That being said, if your server rack is designed in such a fashion that the Rosewill rack rails are able to wrap around the edge of the server rails without pushing back into the interior of the rack, as was the case for me, then it may be an option for you.\n\nBottom line is this chassis is a solid budget choice, but it does have some drawbacks, depending on your needs. If you're willing to live with a bit of inconvenience and have a means to support it well enough in your rack (weight with all parts installed and 15 drives will be ~ 60-75 lbs.), it is a solid, economical choice for a large 3.5\" drive system for a home network NAS or media server. It's not perfect, but it is a good overall value.\n\nYMMV\n\n-------------------------------\n\nEDIT 01.14.2022:\n\nIn my original review, I inadvertently failed to clearly explain an important step if you wish to front-load your drives into the LSV-4500 case. It's a big enough pain that I should have provided more details in my original review, but here goes....\n\nThe LSV-4500 is designed such that you must insert and remove your drives from the rear of each of the three (3) groups of five (5) drives. That means in order to exchange a drive or install a new one you must do the following:\n\n1. Pull the chassis out of your rack.\n2. Remove the chassis lid.\n3. Release the drive cage and slide it partially forward.\n4. Reach to the back of the drive cage, pinch the tabs for the drive you need to remove, and slide the drive rearward.\n5. Remove the attached SATA and power cables.\nIn my original review, I mentioned there is an alternative approach where the drives may be mounted from the front. What I neglected to mention is this method involves minor hacking of the drive cages. Specifically, there are small, metal tabs toward the front of the drive cage, which are designed to stop you from accidentally sliding a drive too far forward and into the path of the front fan blades. So, if you want to be able to front-load your drives you will need to bend these tabs inward so they are flush with the inside side walls of the drive cage. It's not particularly difficult. This can be accomplished with a good set of ordinary pliers or a vice grip.\n\nA downside of front-loading your drives is it also means getting rid of the front mounted fans. There's really no point in keeping that in this configuration, as you'd have to remove them in order to get to the drives, defeating the purpose of having them be accessible from the front of the chassis. The upside is of course it means there's no need to remove the top of the chassis and manipulate the drive cage to remove or add a drive. You may think of this as a \"budget hot swap\" option if you like.\nPersonally, I don't recommend going that route, but if it suits your needs it is an option.\n\n<b>SuperMicro Drive Cage Swap</b>\n\nI've since found there is yet another option if you're interested in tinkering with the RSV-4500. It turns out that SuperMicro 5-disk mobile drive cages happen to fit very nicely in lieu of the stock drive cages. Remove the stock drive cages, insert the SuperMicro mobile drive cage with the LEDs at the top, and secure the SuperMicro cage with 2 screws on top and/or bottom. The cage will be firmly in place, and now you have just added 5 hot swap bays to your chassis.\n\nNext, you have a few possible configurations for this mod. You may then use the SuperMicro drive cage as a hot swap drive cage if you'd like. There is barely enough room to leave the 92mm fan on the rear of the SuperMicro drive cage in place, however I recommend removing it. I conducted some tests with an air velocity tester used by HVAC technicians to measure air speed and throughput, and I found with the SuperMicro 92mm fan blowing into a 120mm fan in the middle drive cage, it actually reduced the amount of air being pushed backward in the case (though I was not able to measure whether or not it improved the hydrostatic pressure). The problem is there's barely any space between the fans. You can move the middle fan rack back further by about 1/2\" via an extra set of screw holes in the side of the chassis, but either way we're talking about less than 2\" of clearance between both fans. Therefore, i recommend removing the SuperMicro 92mm fan from the back of the S.M. drive cage if you implement this design in your chassis. This also solves the problem of trying to route all your SATA cables from the back of the SuperMicro drive cage backplane to your motherboard without getting them in the way of the fans.\n\n<b>Other Information Tid-bits</b>\n\n1. You must use the stock drive cages if you want to use the front mounted fans. The fans are bolted into the fascia of the drive cages, and these are in turn designed to be recessed into the front of the case such that the locking front panel is able to close properly.\n2. There is an air filter built into the lockable front panel.\n3. The middle fan rack can be removed. It may also be adjusted very slightly by moving it back about 1/2\" in the chassis, by mounting it with an alternative set of holes on the side of the chassis."

My first introduction to them was for GPU mining a LONG time ago, if you are willing to remove the cross bar, secondary fan bar, and bays you could easily fit two E-ATX boards inside, or pack a bunch of GPUs on USB<->PCIE risers. The current design (2023) attaches the 120mm fans to the drive bays which is fine unless you plan on removing the drive bays (but want to have front-intake cooling.) These days we are buying them for gaming machines and studio/production workstations, we rack them in a cabinet from the center of the bullpen that exhausts into the attic space leaving our office space quiet and cool, the only cables coming out are 1xUSB and 1xDisplayPort per chassis. There is enough space to fit two radiators, but you may need to upgrade the case fans to exhaust the heat -- the stock fans are reasonably quiet, but the exhaust of the unit is maybe 60-70 cfm which is not enough when you have a 300-450watt GPU and 140-280watt CPU running at max, even with a climate-controlled cabinet/room with a proper barrier. For a typical backoffice server or JBOD box the stock cooling is more than adequate, and the secondary fan bar will actually ensure your drives aren't heat soaking. It's a decent chassis, and hard to beat the price. [10/10] will keep buying these 15 bay chassis for as long as Rosewill is profitable enough to make them :D"

        "review": "I replaced all of the internal fans with Noctua 80mm, and tbh...the sound difference isn't that minimal. I ended up reusing the stock fans in different parts of the case. I did two desktop conversions with these cases, and each worked out although the clearance between the onboard sata ports and the fan housing was so short, I had to remove that housing the get insert the sata cables (and I had to use differing directional angular connections (one up, one down) to fit one of the boards in. I managed to fit 8 drives (6 hdd, 2 sdd) in the drive bay area, but the gap between the drive bays and the motherboard enclosure is a bit small...fortunately, I installed a sas card with thin sata cabling (otherwise, they wouldn't have fit). Clearance between the drives and the fan enclosure is also a few mm too small...cabling coming out of the drives bends sharply against the fan grills (they're ultra thin too), and I ended up breaking one of them (finding out after reassembly...sigh). Being gentle helps there.\n\nThe one real gripe though, is that the psu compartment is too small for all of the psus I have. I got it to fit, but had to take out the mounting bracket as the psu length is an inch or so too long, so it's just wedged in there. The rails come out of the psu and run right into one of the 4 (optional) 80 mm fans, so I could only power the drives and fans off of the two rails that were far enough to the right to avoid that fan.\n\nYou will definitely need fan grills on all internal fans. The 80mm space in the rear doesn't have mounting wholes...do I used HVAC tape. It might sound janky, but its stable.\n\nZip ties area your friend as well at keeping cabling in order. I also ended up getting a Noctua low profile cooler to replace the typical monster sized desktop ones. I had to bend it a bit to get it to clear the ram, and still fit inside the 2U enclosure. Had to remove the ram heat sync's as well, but that Noctua was so large it covered the ram as well, so...I suppose that's a little bit of a positive side effect.\n\nNote to self: never throw away low profile card brackets...the generic ones I ended up using don't really fit the cards.\n\nIn total, it was worth the conversion, although with a 10G and SAS card installed. Drives are the same temperatures as they were in the desktop case (29c-35c) even under continuous load. It took a lot of hours though to get things in and fitting...taking things apart when they dont fit and re-routing cables. The second time around though had a much more clean looking result.\n\nI don't use rails...my rack has three shelves in place as-is, so they're just stacked (bolted, with spaces on the back side for the same clearance I would have gotten with rails)\n\nI think I will go for a 3U or 4U next time just for better clearances for cabling, and more GPU options (which I didn't have for these conversions)."

One of the hot swap bays/modules in my RSV-L4412U is bad, and tech support ignored my email and the phone line hung up on me. Where can I get a spare?\n\nI would advise against getting this unless Rosewill demonstrates publicly that they respond.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAlso this case came with 3 faulty SATA cables. I didn't even attempt to RMA these, I simply used spares I had on hand.\n\nDon't call, their phone number in the manual, simply hangs up after a few minutes on the phone and provides no option to hold. The email in the manual techsupport@rosewill.com looks like it words and their people can check it, but they don't somehow this gets ignored.\n\nTo get a response use RMA@Rosewill.com and even then take response with a grain of salt because they have crap internal communication.\n\nThe spare part number for the hot swap module is: RSV-SATA-Cage-34\n\nThere are retail and RMA versions of this part. I am not clear on the exact difference, but RMA representatives promised me a replacement in 1-2 business 2 weeks ago and I never received any update after that, then I learned they were out of the RMA version. To be fair to them they said there might be other delays but I expected some communication, and that team ghosted me.\n\nEventually a Rosewill representative did call me but only because of this review. They wanted to make whole situation right and offered me the retail version of the part. This rep explained the inventory difference, was puzzled about the non-responses I got but recorded (and verified them, I had all the ID numbers and timestamps). I suspect this is a different team that is less dysfunctional.\n\nDon't use this case unless you have a very reliable checksumming system on your data. I am using ZFS and its checksumming was key in identifying the faulty cables and faulty hot swap module. It is still cheap for what it is, the next cheapest solution is north of double the price. So if you can reliably find silent data errors and have a willingness to troubleshoot this can be made to work.\n\nI moved this to two stars, for now. Since my complaints are mostly around service if I do get the replacement cage I will move this review to 4 stars, because it is now clear they are trying but have crap systems in place now. I can't give 5 stars, it has been more than a month in total and they still haven't gotten me a spare.\n\nUpdate 2\n\nThis review resulted in a call to me, that resulted in a replacement for the faulty part being shipped to me. This took far too long and critical mismanagement like this is part of why I was avoiding NewEgg. Amazon isn't great but at least they respond, and now this replacement shows up in a NewEgg box?! Like they are proud of this level of service. If I had known newegg was involved. I wouldn't have ordered this to begin with.\n\nI had been boycotting newegg because of them having ripped me off a few times and likely criminal levels of shenanigans. I can't go higher than 3 stars knowing this put money into the hands of people I specifically chose not to. I don't think I will be ordering anything from NewEgg or Rosewill for several years and if you do be ready for a hassle if anything goes wrong."

Not a manufacturer I’ve used before but figured for the price and the reported speeds I thought it was value (I always expect the speeds to be lower than reported so didn’t want a 5,500 drive that comes up short). The ps5 reported this drive was running at 6,100 so above the minimum requirements. I transferred 300GB+ from console memory to the drive, took just over 3mins. Can’t think of an occasion where the drive will be transferring a higher load so shouldn’t be any issues with over heating. However the ‘graphene heat shield’ is literally a heat proof sticker and not a heat sink (as it appears from the image, it’s a clever illusion which makes the sticker look 3D) in any event I did not have any issues with performance or thermal throttling while transferring the entire console memory to the drive. I have ordered a heat sink in any event, as maybe I’ll get closer to the reported 7,300 speed but this is mainly for peace of mind more than anything."

En dicho compartimento hay un tornillo que hay que quitar para introducir el SSD. Una vez instalado tienes que atornillarlo de nuevo y poner la cubierta.\n\nEs hora de hablar del rendimiento. El fanxiang S770 de 4 TB ofrece una velocidad de lectura de hasta 7.300 MB/s en PC, mientras que en PS5 es algo inferior. A la hora de escribir puede alanzar hasta 5.400 MB/s. Como puedes ver, son unas velocidades de transferencia muy rápidas. Así pues, no hace falta decir que este SSD se convierte en una excelente opción para todos aquellos quieran ampliar la capacidad almacenamiento de la consola de Sony por poco dinero.\n\nEl fanxiang S770 de 4 TB también es una opción a tener en cuenta si juegas en PC. De hecho, cada vez hay más juegos donde se recomienda tener una de estas unidades de almacenamiento rápido, por ejemplo, The Last of Us Parte I. En definitiva, es uno de los SSD más rápidos que puedes conseguir ahora mismo a buen precio, y por si fuera poco incluye el disipador de calor, algo que nunca está de más.\n\nLos SSD de 4 TB de marcas como Samsung y WD suelen más caros, mientras que el fanxiang S770 de 4TB puede ser tuyo por tan solo 230 euros. ¡Vaya chollo! Es un precio muy tentador y más si tenemos en cuenta que estamos hablando de un SSD compatible con PS5. A nivel de rendimiento, no tiene nada que envidar a otros SSD de marcas mucho más conocidas."

        "review": "Encore peu connue en France, Fanxiang est une marque chinoise qui propose des SSD à des prix particulièrement compétitifs. Mais pas cher ne signifie pas médiocre pour autant. Le SSD S880 a subi 88 heures de tests rigoureux ainsi que 5 tests stricts histoire de garantir sa résistance et sa fiabilité sur le long terme. Le SSD dispose d’une garantie de 5 ans et Fanxiang annonce une endurance de 2800 TBW.\n\n🔳 Caractéristiques détaillés du SSD S880 4TB :\nModèle: 5880\nInterface: M.2 2280 (protocolo NVMe 1.4)\nContrôleur SSD : MAP1602A from MaxioTech\nModules Mémoire : 232-layer TLC NAND flash (Made by YMTC)\nTempérature de fonctionnement: 0°C-70°C\nTempérature de stockage : -40°C-85°C\nPoids: 0.045g\nTaille: 80*22*2.5~3.4mm\nCapacité: 4To\nService après-vente: 5 ans\n\nInstallé dans un boitier externe USB-C Thunderbolt 3 (40Gbps) en tant que disque de sauvegarde 4TB pour mon Macbook Pro (oui je sais c'est overkill), ce disque annonce des performances vraiment excellentes (7300MB/s en lecture séquentielle et 6800MB/s en écriture séquentielle). Hélas je n'ai jamais réussi à les atteindre puisque le TB3 même à 40Gbps n'est pas assez rapide.\n\nVoici mon feedback sur ce disque SSD S880 4TB:\n✅ RAPPORT QUALITÉ/PRIX IMBATTABLE à ce niveau de capacité/performance\n✅ Équipé d’un autocollant de dissipation thermique au graphène, cela permet une dissipation de la chaleur et empêcher le SSD d’atteindre des températures élevées.\n✅ Format M.2 2280 compact tout ce qu'il y a de plus classique.\n✅ Il exploite à merveille l’interface PCIe 4.0 NVMe 4X pour offrir des débits extrêmement élevés...\n✅ ...tout en conservant une consommation et une chauffe maîtrisée (ça chauffe quand même pas mal hein, on ne va pas se mentir)\n✅ Vitesse annoncée jusqu’à 7300 Mbps en lecture séquentielle et jusqu’à 6800 Mbps en écriture séquentielle. De mon côté, j'étais plutôt sur environ la moitié des chiffres annoncés (en USB-C donc). Je n'ai pas pu vérifier sur un PC en PCI 4.0 4X.\n✅ Débits théorique 13 fois supérieurs à ceux d'un SSD SATA.\n✅ 2800 TBW !!\n✅ Garantie 5 ans.... 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼\n❌ Pas de cache DRAM ! Mais il y a un pseudo cache SLC pour les bursts d'écriture\n❌ Une marque encore très jeune (les S880 sont sortis en Avril 2023, c'est très récent...). Il y a peu de recul encore sur la fiabilité long terme. D'où le fait que je l'ai mis en disque de sauvegarde, car il sera peu sollicité, et si un jour une sauvegarde n'aboutit pas car le disque est défaillant, je pourrai toujours le changer rapidement, plutôt que de perdre toutes les données d'un disque principal en production ^^\n\nLe mot de la fin : Sur mes premiers essais depuis plusieurs mois, les performances restent stratosphériques pour un disque utilisé en externe en plus. C'est pour moi un excellent achat. Je vous le conseille."

Fatto questo si prende il dissipatore che si posizionerà sopra il pad termico e si preme verso il basso cosi da fissarsi.\n\nAll'interno della confezione troviamo 5 viti nere, ne vanno usate 4 per bloccare l'SSD al dissipatore con il piccolo giravite in dotazione.\n\nFatto questo è tutto pronto e dobbiamo smontare la ps5 prendendola in posizione orizzontale, facendo scorrere prendendo gli estremi e sollevandola leggermente. Davanti a voi dovete avere il retro della ps5, messa in posizione orizzontale dovete farla scorrere verso sinistra. È una procedura che richiedere una leggera forza all'inizio e pazienza, anche se non riuscite subito, prendetevi un attimo e riprovate con calma senza farvi prendere dalla foga.\n\nRimosso il pannello, in alto troverete un alloggiamento per l'SSD aggiuntivo. Rimuovete la vite, il coperchio e inserite l'SSD completo di dissipatore nel giusto verso. Con la rondella e la vita presenti fissiamo il tutto e richiediamo coperchio e Ps5.\n\nUna volta accesa la Ps5 apparirà il messaggio che vi dirà di aver rilevato il nuovo SSD e se formattarlo. Cliccate su formatta, fatto questo vi indicherà la velocità massima di lettura e sarà pronto all'uso.\n\nLa procedura non è difficile, richiede molta pazienza ma è fattibile per tutti, nulla di trascendentale. Adesso c'è tantissimo spazio e non bisogna più cancellare giochi e salvataggi.\n\nPRO\nPs5 finalmente completa in tutto, installazione intuitiva, SSD capiente\n\nCONTRO\nVelocità effettiva inferiore a quella dichiarata\n\nAdesso la mia Ps5 ha lo spazio necessario per poter giocare con serenità senza stare lì a rimuovere o fare calcoli su cosa salvare o cancellare.\n\nPeccato per la velocità dichiarata che non viene raggiunta e per questo motivo lo valuto 4 stelle ma resta comunque un valore di tutto rispetto.\n\nSe volete una Ps5 capiente e funzionale con più giochi installati sopra, questo SSD può fare al caso vostro, va bene per entrambe le versioni di Ps5.\n\nSpero di esservi stato utile."

Controlliamolo insieme!\n\n⚙️ SPECIFICHE TECNICHE:\nFanxiang lancia questo prodotto con un bel pacchetto di specifiche, partiamo innanzitutto da un PCIe 4.0 che garantisce alla PS5 di leggerlo (PS5 non è compatibile con nessun NVMe che non sia almeno PCIe 4.0), poi troviamo ben 2GB di DRAM nel caso della variante da 2TB della Sk Hynix, chip che promettono bene, affiancato da una NAND di YMTC ed un controller di InnoGrit entrambi assolutamente niente male, a livello di componentistica usata per quanto mi riguarda, c'è da stupirsi considerato il prezzo!\n\n🚀 MA QUANTO E' VELOCE?:\nMantiene la promessa fatta, infatti grazie al PCIe 4.0 affiancato da delle componenti evidentemente di livello, raggiunge senza problemi i promessi 7000MB/s in Read e 6600MB/s in Write, assolutamente niente male!\n\n🎮 PS5 READY:\nLa PS5 digerisce tranquillamente questo SSD ed una volta in game, le prestazioni che fornisce sono assolutamente equiparabili al SSD nativo della Play, carica molto velocemente i giochi e grazie alla DRAM li sposta anche molto velocemente tra SSD Esterno e interno o viceversa.\n\n🟨 Nota: Il profilo del dissipatore passivo è ottimizzato per PS5, questo significa che lo shielding che devi rimontare per chiudere il vano del inserimento SSD su PS5 si chiude tranquillamente anche con il dissipatore installato.\n\n🔥 DURABILITA':\nFanxiang garantisce ben 1400TBW di durabilità (ovvero 1400TB di scrittura su disco), che sono tantissimi, facendo finta che ogni gioco per PS5 sia di 100GB, dovreste scaricare 100GB di giochi per 14 MILA VOLTE.\n\n🕒 3 MESI DOPO E QUALITA' PREZZO:\nAd oggi non ho avuto nessunissimo problema con questo disco e mi sento di essere pronto a consigliarvelo, le performance che ho ottenuto sono state davvero ottimali soprattutto per il prezzo pagato, per quanto mi riguarda ne vale la pena.\n\n🏁 FACCIAMO IL PUNTO:\nUn disco di un brand emergente che contro ogni aspettativa (considerando i trascorsi dei nuovi brand di SSD orientali), si comporta benissimo ed ha velocità assolutamente adeguate a quello che promette.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5"

I'm keeping 1 old and 1 new stick in and it's working fine. Running a memtest now but I expect it to pass. I suspect the issue is with the laptop rather than the ram. The laptop maximum is 4GB but it may be having issues at its limit? Booted it to Linux Peppermint once after the change and it's clearly much faster than it was so I'm happy from a speed perspective without testing that specifically."

This one just feels light and cheap. So far it works just fine, but I was expecting it to be more like my older one.\n\nI really wish they had spent money on making a better quality case than the fancy LED stuff that I really have no interest in. Yes you can turn off the LED or change it to a fixed color. By repeatedly long or short pressing the LED button you can cycle through various fade modes, fixed colors or off. The color selected is memorized if the drive is powered off.\n\nThe supplied USB cord plugs into the dock with the USB-C end and the other has a USB-C with an adapter to also fit USB-A which is very nice. Cable also seems to be of high quality.\n\nAnother difference from the older Orico dock I have is the drive bay flap. The dive accommodates 2.5\" and 3.5\" drives but the drive bay flap is just one solid flap. On my older dock there is a cutout for 2.5\" drives such that the flap pops up around the smaller drive and stabilizes it (3.5\" drive fills the slot and so is stable). In this dock the flap just stays pushed down into the hole and the 2.5\" drive is more prone to wobbling on it's connector. Since I will be using 2.5\" drives inserted all the time it makes me want to disassemble and modify the flap! I guess the one advantage of the solid flap is that if the dock sits empty it will keep the dust out.\n\nIn use the dock works well and seems to get high transfer speeds.\n\nThe manual pretty much just explains how to use offline drive copy if you have the two bay dock. I have the single bay one and there really isn't any compelling reason to read the manual. It doesn't explain how to change LED modes at all.\n\nI needed a second dock for another machine and this one has a better USB 3.2 interface than the old which is USB 3.0. It will get the job done, but I'm left feeling it's a lower quality device than the older one. Even the power supply seems like a cheaper one. So this is why I knocked off one star, I can't really fault the way it operates though."

        "review": "This is an excellent hot swap storage drive dock that not only looks great, but works without any hassle. The drive has a two part cover tray that can fit both a 2.5” or a standard 3.5” hard drive. Simply just take whatever hard drive you have on hand, and slot in as labeled depending on the size format. For somebody like me, who switched over to NVMe drives ages ago, I have a lot of spare internal drives that were collecting dust in my closet until now. With this, I am able to use those old drives and store recordings, music, games and more and label them accordingly. The RGB lighting is also a nice touch and looks good on my desk. It fits with my setup and doesn’t take away from the aesthetic. Overall, I love how simple and easy this is to use and I think it’ll be incredibly useful for those that need to store a lot of data or want to breathe new life into old HDDs. I highly recommend it."

There is only 1 cpu fan that actually fits in this case and since I didn't buy that one I decided to bend the frame of the case to get the motherboard in and lucky enough it had no issues closing the case when bent back.

I have a low power N5005 motherboard in here and everything worked reasonably well until I added the last 2 drives. Even at idle, the drives just start heating up with no end in sight - especially the middle two. The drive temps hit around 50C within a few minutes of being turned on (but idle) - I'd hate to see what a parity sync would do at this point!\nI replaced the 80mm stock fan with a noctua and added a 40mm noctua to the front to improve ventilation, it had no impact at all. I've currently got the top off the case with a regular oscillating fan pointed at the drives to stop them from cooking while I wait for a better case to arrive.\nDon't bother with this unless you're going to leave some of the drive trays empty (which defeats the purpose) or if you're planning on using 2.5\" disks.\nThis case will cook your 3.5\" disks on your first parity sync."

It does have some drawbacks and difficulty building but if you really need a tiny custom NAS over something like a QNAP/Synology then this is the best you will find assuming can’t use something bigger.\n\nBuilding in this case is not easy and was very difficult due to the size so new PC builders should not start with this case in my opinion.\n\nA simple but massive improvement to this case design as others have mentioned would be if the drive caddy could be removed by screws as it is currently riveted in. This would make the motherboard install way easier. Even with a CPU cooler that is within spec for height, it still did not want to go in without a fight, I had to bend the case slightly to get it in. Once it is in though, it does have clearance, but cause of that drive caddy actually does not fit natively.\n\nAnother improvement would be if they cut another air hole in the front panel and added mounts for a second 40 mm fan on the opposite of the one it already supports. This would help add a little bit more airflow and there is room for it, so why not?\n\nLots of cables need to be plugged in prior to installing the board as again the drive caddy is in the way. For my board, this required plugging all of the PSU cables to the board and the front panel connectors ahead of time.\n\nThe SATA cables needed to be plugged into the rear of the drive caddy first and not the board side as plugging into the back of the drive caddy was quite difficult for how tight it is with that sharp turn. Also be aware that the included SATA cables are shorter than standard which is good for the case since it does not have a lot of room for cable management but depending on where the SATA ports are on your board there could be a length issue, mine just barely reached.\n\nI replaced the rear fan with a Noctua one as it’s a lot better than the stock fan however for me at least, I highly recommend removing the rear fan regardless to make the SATA connections easier. You can still squeeze the fan by the cables afterwards.\n\nRegarding temperatures as others mentioned the cooling is not amazing here even with my replacement rear fan. One thing that helped for me was setting a custom fan curve and using the PCH as my temp target instead of the CPU as in my case the CPU will likely be a lower temperature than the PCH on average.\n\nOne last thing since it only supports Flex ATX PSUs, there are a lot of issues with those having very loud fans. If you can handle the steep price, the SilverStone Technology FX600 is the most efficient Flex ATX PSU on the market and if you truly use this system as a NAS, you will never hear it as your load will never be high enough for the PSU fan to need to ramp up. Full load my system is under 100 watts.\n\nSystem Specs:\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 R5 Pro 5650GE\nCPU Cooler: Noctua NH-L9a-AM4\nRam: 2 x 16 GB DDR4 2400 ECC\nSSD: Samsung 960 Pro 1 TB with EKWB EK-M.2 NVMe Heatsink, Black\nSSD: 2 x 128 GB M.2 SATA SSDs in a 2 Port M.2 SSD to PCI-e x1 adapter B\nHDD: 4 x 12 TB HGST WD Ultrastar DC HC520\nCase: KCMconmey 4 + 1 Bay DIY NAS Case\nPSU: SilverStone Technology FX600"

As others have mentioned, the case is a bit tight to work in, which is expected for this size. Making the drive cage removable would greatly improve the install process, as it stands - you may have to play component Tetris when installing. I would definitely recommend testing components first before installing. Also, due to the fact that the drive cage is right over the motherboard, you will most likely need a low profile cpu cooler. Another issue I ran into was that the included sata cables were too short to reach the sata ports on my motherboard, they were also too stiff and thick to manage. I ended up buying longer, thinner, more flexible cables (4 sata cables bundled into 1) which solved that issue. The 4 cables bundled together were able the thickness of 1 included sata cable.\nOther than the expected install challenges, I haven’t had any issues. No sign of I/O errors when using the drive back panel, but then didn’t use the included sata cables which may have had wires broken when bent."

The PCB is stupidly thinner than I would like. and you HAVE to plug the SATA cables BEFOREHAND, BEFORE you put the m.2 adapter into the motherboard.\n\nDO NOT place the m.2 adapter INTO the motherboard BEFORE adding SATA cables. Also make sure your SATA cables are adequately long enough so they don't strain the port. Or else the m.2 adapter WILL FLEX IN WEIRD DISTURBING ANGLES.\n\nDespite all the cons of this product.

My board has a maximum of 4 SATA ports and I only needed a few more so this M.2 adapter was perfect for my needs as I wasn't using the M.2 slot already.\nSo far this expansion card has worked flawlessly and transparently; no drivers needed and my drives showed up as they should.\nThere were other reviews worrying about how hot the chipset gets and after running a 1 hour write test to both connected drives at the same time I only measured a peak temperature of about 125F. However for peace of mind I stuck a small Raspberry Pi heatsink to help with longevity.\nAlso, yeah, those activity LEDs are **BRIGHT** and they light up the inside of the case so I recommend doing something like putting a piece of electrical tape over them if they're an issue for you.\n\nI'll update this review if anything arises, but so far everything is good (also as a note I bought this used)."

I'm sure I can figure out a way to tape over it or whatever, but it is pretty wild how bright that thing is. Also wild that there's no software to be rid of it.\n\nBut, it seems to be working as it should overall. It was more or less plug and play. My latest mobo only had four SATA ports and I used those up quickly. I got my oldest HDD plugged into this thing right now, so speeds are a non issue in my situation. I'm not gonna be pushing any advertised speeds or anything with an older drive so I didn't even benchmark. I will definitely be leaning towards a dedicated NAS or reeling in some of my data hoarding (ha!) rather than use this thing long term though. It just feels a little finicky for my use on my daily machine. But it was the band aid I needed in the meantime. I got it open-box from Amazon Warehouse and it looked unused, so no complaints at all with the price I paid. Maybe a bit too steep at retail. I might find a use for it in another build, who knows!

The other vacant slot would choke my gpu.\n\nThe card is sturdy and feels high quality. If you're installing a full sized card, there is a standoff and screw preinstalled on the board for that. They do include another set of these if you are installing something smaller.\n\nI have a Sabrent 1TB ssd rated for 3000ish mb/s and obviously I won't be getting that. I was hoping for something along the lines of 700 or 800, but oh well. Maybe I'll move it to a higher slot or get a better mobo with more m.2 slots. For now though, these speeds will do, it's almost 3 times faster than my standard HDD."

I had it initially on an almost 10 years old motherboard, it worked, but \"vanished\" intermittently. I moved it on a 4-5 years old mother board and it works flawlessly since. None of these motherboards had a native M.2 socket, so I guess it is something in the design of the older motherboard that fails to maintain proper communication with the adapter.

It is nice that its somewhat modular to some degree with parts being moveable in some situations; ex. moving the power switch to the top. They provide enough hardware to have spare hardware for some out of the box thinking. Overall its a nice little case and 1/3 the size of my previous case which is good for me. Using an ATX motherboard, there really isn't much room for fans behind the acrylic fan mount. The positioning of the main 24 pin lead from the power supply doesn't work well with the limited space in that front area. My only suggestion would be to increase the frame size, make the acrylic fan mount modular/moveable or provide a cheap power adapter that is thin and uniform.\n\nUsing this frame for a tfuel miner so its basic and I would buy this frame again for this type of use."

However, since it doesn't accept accessory power, and it has 7 total USB ports (including USB C), it definitely cannot power a bunch of higher power draw devices at once. A single USB C port itself can exceed the entire power draw limit of the PCIe slot this goes into.\n\nIf it did have accessory power (meaning, extra power provided over a cable from the power supply), it'd be a lot more versatile and charging support more devices. However, it does work well for things like flash drives, connecting phones, and powering more basic devices.\n\nIf you don't need to connect high power draw devices, this should work well enough!"

My Samsung T7 can transfer at 900-1000 megabytes per second when connected to a dedicated usb 10gbps port, but on this it cannot go beyond 380-390 megabytes per second.

The product comes with a mini cd-rom that includes the driver. I did not need to us it as Windows 11 detected the card automatically.

        "review": "Review for PCIe x1 type e + 19 pin.\nI've only used it with the 19 pin connector and it seems to work fine at around the expected data throughput speed of 400MBps (3.2 Gbps) with a fast external drive. This is consistent with the claim of 5 Gbps USB3 gen 1 performance.\nThe caveats:\nFirst, and most important, is that it has no power supply connexion beyond the relatively meagre supply from the PCIe bus; this means that it could have difficulty operating high power USB devices, especially if more than one is connected.\nSecond, the total data rate might be a problem if more than one fast USB device is attached, because the available PCIe x1 throughput will be exceeded. However, in normal use, diversity of bandwidth demand between devices would probably come to the rescue.\nThird, it was a trifle expensive, but not excessively so.\nGenerally, though, I am well satisfied. At least it worked, which is more than can be said for a previously tried card from another manufacturer."

        "review": "This case was a beast to put together, but once together provides a nice 12U server case for home use (or portable use with the wheels). Overall I'd give this is good rating for anyone looking for a home server rack, and am definitely pleased with my purchase, but there were a few cons that makes it a 4, not a 5 star.\n\nThe big drawback:\nThe back is screwed in. Meaning if you need to get to back cables easily, you're out of luck. My rails block any side-access, and so getting to the back of a server's power or network cables is near impossible. A flaw if you need to actually work on anything, but not so bad if it's all meant to be left untouched.\n\nPros:\n- Great Price\n- Solid Rack\n- Just does what it's supposed to do.\n- Comes with some nice extras (power bar, fan, etc) so you don't have to hunt down those pieces.\n- Fits full length servers (eg R610). I've also commented this in the cons as they're a very tight fit, but they fit! So it goes in both pro and con.\n\nCons:\n- Instructions are difficult to follow\n- Door is not easily reversible.\n- Two sets of keys; one for side locks, one for front (Yeah, you don't think this is a big deal - but just wait)\n- Screws are on the outside, meaning if you didn't have the keys, a simple Phillips would unlock it.\n- The frame is not \"square\" until all the parts are screwed in. The back panel is what's keeping my rack level and lined up.\n- Shipped with missing screws; had to contact seller. (or this could be a pro... seller responded quickly and sent me extra screws - was very pleased about that).\n- While the inside is the advertised 35\" depth, the maximum post distance is 33\". Unfortunately cable and bezel room are needed so the maximum realistic post distance is 28-29\". Measure your devices accordingly. This barely fit the length of an R610 due to power/network cables at the back and bezel at the front.\n- \"Free\" rack is only 21.5\" deep and requires posts to be set at that depth. The rack is useless if you require deeper post distance (such as with a Dell R610), so mine is in a parts pile somewhere.\n\nEven with all these \"Cons\" I would highly recommend this product as I found nothing that matches the price-point for the nice simple 12U full-length rack you get. Honestly, even if they fixed some of the small things like the 2-sets of keys and maybe the free-rack being expandable, I'd have bumped this to a 5-star, but there's no 4 1/2 so that's life."

        "review": "Update2: The parts that were damaged in shipping were replaced by the manufacturer. Thanks so much for that! Now that I have undamaged panels, I can say this rackmount system is really nice. It looks great. It's very heavy duty and there's nothing wobbly. It's longer than I expected, it's a long rectangle - but that's fine. The instructions for assembling it are a little unclear, but you can find videos online.\n\nUpdate: The manufacturer contacted me and they will send me replacement pieces for the damaged parts, and that the damage must have happened in shipping. Once I get those parts and install them, I will update my rating - I think this will be a great cabinet once I get parts that aren't damaged.\n\nI am super disappointed in this purchase. I paid almost $500 and another &70 for shipping on top of that. The delivery box was in pretty good shape but once opened it was clear the unit that was delivered to me has been used before. It is damaged in multiple places. All of the small screws/bolts/nuts were not in bags, so they were all strewn about the inside of the box - I'm sure having all those small metal pieces rattling around inside the box through transit contributed to some of the issues with this unit. Take a look at the pictures. Both sides and the rear are badly bent so that they don't fit well. One of the mechanisms that holds one of the sides in place has been torn...It's plastic, seems like someone forced one of the sides to open without using the Open mechanism. The worst part - the top piece of this unit is badly damaged. It is ugly. I don't think I can use this unit. I'm not sure how possible it is to get a refund now, but if you're thinking about purchasing one please know that I regret this purchase."

        "review": "This is actually a pretty decent rack. It took me over an hour to setup excluding taking out of the packaging. A few pieces are bent and dented (see photos) so FedEx really gave this thing a beating because it’s steel.\n\nThe instructions that come with this are terrible! For instance they say don’t tighten the bolts until step 6. But you need to tighten them before this step! So I had to assemble and disassemble a few parts here and there as I realized the instructions didn’t clearly convey the part needed. The one thing the instructions don’t mention are the 4 screws needed for the front and are apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the rack! I didn’t have them in and even with everything in place, the rack flexed a lot. As soon as I put the screws in, it was solid. I also struggled with assembling the front lock as it came apart trying to put the locking lever on. See photo of how this should go.\n\nSpeaking of screws, quality control failed and I came across some screws that still had the metal in the middle. See photo comparing the bad screws to good screws and you’ll see what I mean. Thankfully there are plenty of extra screws!\n\nFinally this rack cuts down noise a lot. It’s not soundproof, but it made my office noticeably quieter. I have a Catalyst 3750-X, a HP Proliant DL360p G8, and a Supermicro all on and running. I couldn’t do this before.\n\nThe exhaust fan at the top also helps a lot and is the one reason I got this rack.\n\nThe only major complaints I have is that the rear panel is screwed on, not latched like the side panels. This makes working in the back difficult as that is where I put the PDU. The PDU is also pretty cheap feeling. I have plans to replace it. I wouldn’t use it long term.\n\nOverall, great rack. I just knocked a star off because of the bad instructions."

It took much longer to put it together than needed, and for some items (e.g., installing locks, door latches, etc.) there were no instructions at all. Other areas the instructions were so vague I had to guess (still not sure parts are put together correctly...)\n- Back panel is screwed in, which if you're working with anything over around 30\" in depth, makes it challenging to work on from the side. That means you will either need to leave the back panel off or unscrew it each time. Recommend making the back panel work on a latch system similar to the sides, or at the very least, use thumb screws that can be easily removed.\n- Front panel droops quite a bit when open. It is not a big deal, but may want to consider adding some thicker/more durable washers on the hinges.\n\nAll-in-all, very happy with the purchase and recommend it!"

        "review": "The Cooler Master MasterCase H500P Mesh (in white) is a versatile mid tower case, with fairly excellent cooling right out of the box.\n\nThe Basics\n\nThe case can accommodate full sized ATX motherboards, as well as those smaller standards such as microATX and miniITX. Note: there are indicators for E-ATX, however it looks like a tight fit. For full compatibility listings visit Cooler Master’s website.\n\nAll screws and extra components come in a box. Sadly the screws are all in a single non-reusable bag, so you will need to sort and store them accordingly.\n\nOther extras include a bundle of small zip ties, a molex to three pin fan adapter, a mounting bracket for an optional fan mount in the front of the case, an RGB controller, and a cleaning cloth.\n\nStandoffs do not come per-installed, so this is likely the first thing you’ll be doing. The processes is straightforward. Each motherboard form factor has clearly labeled letter markings on the back-plate, indicating where to install your standoffs.\n\nMy Take\n\nCooler Master has done a good job of communicating this case’s specification, so I won’t waste time rehashing that info. It can be found both on the Amazon’s product page as well as CM’s website. Instead I’d like to point out some more nuanced facts.\n\nThe product page lists five 2.5” SSD mounts. This is only half true. There are five potential mounting positions, but only two included mounting brackets. These are proprietary brackets, and as of the writing of this review, I have not found these same brackets for sale on Cooler Master’s website. Or anywhere else for that matter. They may exist, I’ve just been unable to find them. So out of the box you have two, 2.5” SSD brackets, not five.\n\nThere are 4 positions inside the case for mounting SSDs. Two on top of the back of the PSU shroud, and two on the motherboard back-plate. The fifth is dependent on if you are using the 3.5” drive cage, since it is on top of the cage.\n\nThis configuration allows for flexibility, however the inclusion of only two SSD brackets is something I take issue with. Considering the wasteful cable shroud that’s included with this case, I can’t help but think, that metal could have instead gone into the inclusion of five SSD brackets instead of two. It’s worth mentioning that Cooler master ditched the cable shroud on the H500, which is a more budget oriented version of this case.\n\nYour total out of the box drive capacity is four: two 2.5” SSD drives and two 3.5” drives. You could of course use the 3.5” drives for SSDs. However, this is still disappointing seeing as most ATX motherboards can support up to six SATA devices, and the tooling is already in place for additional SSD storage.\n\nThe 3.5” drive bay can be shifted slightly backwards for better cooling and or radiator support.\n\nUsing a PSU I had lying around, I was able to determine that even with the drive cage in its farthest back position, there was still plenty of room for routing PSU cables.\n\nThe power supply shroud can be removed in two pieces. So you can, as I plan to, go with just a half shroud to improve overall airflow (not that it’s really needed with this case in it’s default config).\n\nOverall I’m happy with the construction and all that’s included for your money. You’re getting a highly flexible case with pretty excellent out of the box cooling, and just about everything you need to get building. If you like the aesthetic and are looking for a case that does not sacrifice on airflow, I recommend the H500P Mesh. It certainly comes close to being my perfect case, but misses the mark in a few key areas.\n\nWhat I would do to improve this product:\n\n-include more SSD brackets\n-ditch cable shroud on mobo back-plate\n-add USB 3.1 IO (come on it’s 2019 and your case costs $200)\n-include optional mesh top panel for better top mounted cooling support\n-make 3.5” cage more versatile (top mounting options or complete modular design)\n-use a Phillips head screw on the tempered glass side panel so people will stop complaining about it"

        "review": "Even though this case design is older, I find it to be one of the better so-called 'testbenches' out there if you don't want an 'open to the air' solution. There's ample room to run cables, and the clearance for air cooling is great (I'm using a Noctura NH-D15 with 2 fans and there more than enough room), but beware if you're running a longer power supply (I have a Thermaltake 1300W one, and I have about an inch of clearance from the Xdock sata power adapter), or have a 40x0 card for length (my 3080 XC3 Ultra fits without an issue, though).\n\nOnly problem that I had with the case was that the rightmost USB3 port did not work, and I don't really like the two 3.5\" removable disk rack power (it's a soldered SATA power jack coming off the xdock..I believe this used to be a molex plug which I would have preferred for powering the drives in that dock).\n\nAs for future use, I'd hope they'd do a redesign and offer a USB-C front port plug along with the USB3 ones. Unlike some other reviews, I didn't find that the power switch was spongy, it clicks on/off easily with a satisfying click noise.\n\nOpened a support ticket for the 2nd USB3 port, so we'll see what happens with that."

        "review": "I purchased the Stryker because my last tower case which had more than a half dozen builds over 20 years became obsolete mostly due to lack of fan options to keep up with the latest hardware that require higher airflow, larger fan options, radiator support and cable management. The first good thing I noticed about the Stryker is the handle (there's actually two - one hidden reached through the rear lid), but unlike my old awkward to carry light aluminum tower, the Stryker is a 30lb+ (empty) steel and plastic beast that many would need a dolly to move without the handles. It's almost a requisite rather than option that the handles are included - one of those you can never go back options for awhile I think.\n\nInitially, I just swapped my gear out from my old tower to the Stryker and both my CPU & GPU temps dropped over 5c using the supplied fans and nothing additional.\n\nCable management is good. There is plenty of room for cables to be hidden away from view behind the motherboard with many wire tie mounts and cutout holes - only a few of the cutouts have rubber grommets, but those that don't have nice dull rounded painted edges so no worry about sharp edges damaging cables or fingers. An extra 8 pin cpu cable is provided if your power supply leaves you short. After setting up I found better ways to route, but it's easy to change and wire ties are only 2 cents each.\n\nThe Stryker is one of the best looking cases available (many have copied) and is different because of the nice thick white finish with black highlights instead the usual all black enthusiast cases that we've been seeing for the past 25 years. Though, I initially would have chosen the nearly identical Trooper with black finish had the Stryker not been about $60 less with the sale price and rebate, in the end I think I made the better choice. The Trooper has a E-SATA front panel additionally the Stryker lacks that, but there is a cutout present since the top panel is from the same mold. Plenty of spare parts available at the Coolermaster site for both versions, so you can replace, mix and match at will.\n\nThere are 4 USB top ports (two 2.0 and two 3.0), mic, headphone jack are arranged to be seen and easily reached at a perfect angle - unlike my old case where they were recessed behind a door that you could not see with the door open without bending your neck awkwardly to see in order to plug in.\n\nThere is an external hot swap SSD tray below the front panel which is a nice option for movable data storage for backup or perhaps booting from a secondary OS or setup.\n\nIt's a huge tower case even wider than my old server tower and that extra space allows for taller components such as the giant cpu air coolers we see today - which the ThermalTake C5 on my last build forced me to move a window mounted fan to the outside due to interference of the side panel. With the Stryker case any air cooler on the market will fit and the C5 did even though I changed it out for a 280mm AIO.\n\nThe Stryker accommodates up to 12 2/3\" long triple fan video cards such as the 11 3/4\" ASUS ROG STRIX Series cards with room to spare without modification or removing drive cages.\n\nThe Stryker includes 4 fans, two supplied 120mm LED fans setup as intakes mounted on the side which are typically moved to the front by rotating the drive cages 90 degrees, 1 rear 140mm rear exhaust fan and 1 200mm top exhaust fan. All connected to an easy to reach six speed push button fan controller that has a separate LED on/off switch for LED devices two which are connected to LED's on the front fans leaving one unused lead for another LED device.\n\nI like having a manual easy to reach six speed fan controller where the 3 LED's light up begining with the first LED dim for 1st speed, then bright for 2nd speed, then 2 LED's dim for third speed 2 bright for 4th etc. The caveat since it's a manual push button controller is the fans cannot be controlled via software so no making temperature based fan curves, and no fan rpm readouts unless you run the 3rd fan lead to other rpm headers. I did just that with two of the 3 wire fans. Since only two of the 3 fan wires are utilized by the voltage based fan controller, I pulled the third wire out of the connectors and inserted them into extra connector plug and then plugged those two plugs into a couple unoccupied motherboard headers which allows monitoring the speed. Though I can't use the speed readings for mapping fan curves I can set parameters that can turn on a LED, execute sound file, or shut the system down should the fan speed fall above or below those parameters.\n\nThere are 3 supplied removable dust screens for keeping the internals clean.\n\nI removed the supplied 200mm fan in order to install a Corsair H110i AIO. That is a 280mm radiator setup as a push exhaust. The Stryker can fit nearly any standard radiator in that top position 120, 140, 240 and a 280mm and you could even fit a 360mm on top with a bit of modification such as giving up two top drive spaces and perhaps adding a couple mount holes or expanding the top void cutout. The H110i with the 25mm thick fan and 27mm radiator (52mm or 2+ inches total) nearly encroaches upon the CPU power header (on an ATX ASUS M5a99fx pro 2.0) making it difficult to plug in due to the cable route making a 90 around the fan rad then a 180 to plug into the motherboard header, a tricky set of turns but after that there's plenty of clearance from the fan once plugged in. Obviously there's not enough space there for both push and pull fan setup inside due to fan motherboard encroachment, so if you want push pull setup there is room between the steel case top and the plastic top cover lid to add 1 full size 25mm thick 120/140mm fan in position 1 (fan 3) towards case rear and the second fan position (fan 4) is limited to a 120mm slim (15mm thick) fan due to case handle mount interference. Even though the 280mm radiator does not have the correct mounts for a 120mm fan there is a set of 120mm holes in the case, so you must mount the fan 4 to the case holes prior installing radiator thus no adapter or mod required - again a slightly modified (slimmer smaller fan) push pull is an option here for a either size radiator setup.\n\nThere are two unused 120mm fan positions on the bottom of case behind the power supply for intake, but you must remove the 2.5\" bottom mounted SSD drive cage to mount one fan and remove the tool box to have enough airflow to mount two 120mm fans. I added both optional fans as intake as I don't see needing more than 9 drives for this setup which the top two cages provide in 5.25, 3.5 and 2.5 inch sizes including the 2.5 SSD external hot swap. That bottom space is also an optional 240mm radiator mounting location. I checked it to see if I could mount my 280mm radiator there and there was plenty of room, but I'd have to drill extra holes since the eight holes provided are for two 120mm fans. Not sure why they didn't just drill the extra set of holes like they did for the top. There is a 3rd radiator space at the 140mm rear exhaust port.\n\nThe Stryker is the by far the best case with the most options I've ever built a system with in my nearly 30 years of building computers for personal use and work on occasion. Where size doesn't matter I would use nothing less, but with all the options I spent more time on this simple first build than I ever recall in the past mostly because with all the different ways to do things I found myself testing all options and then re doing again till I found the method I liked best.\n\nA few cons worth mentioning.\n\nThe low tech fan controller - manual adjustment only and no speed readout without modification by integrating the rpm wire with another header. Not a big deal but just a little nit pick that bothered me.\n\nThere is a lack of tool less options here, sure they include quick flex mount 3.5\" drive trays and a large bag of thumb screws for all else but even my 20+ year old tower I upgraded from had tool less drive cages that could be locked in or out with a simple rotation of a lever. Again no big deal, but...\n\nThe setup manual is incomplete and confusing at best. Fairly normal due to both language barrier as well as the right people not hired to write a manual. Again no big deal we're big boys here, we don't need directions.\n\nAlso, the use of Molex connectors for both the panel which provides a lead routed into the case and the hot swap SSD which has a hidden molex header.\n\nAll the panel options had cable leads inside the case ready to be connected one which was a molex. After installing most everything I realized there was no power LED lead for the motherboard or SATA lead for the hot swap SSD. The pwr LED was easily resolved by the realization the motherboard connection was unnecessary as it was powered from the molex lead to the panel. I didn't realize there was a second molex to be connected, until looking for the missing SATA connector using a dental mirror I found two headers on on the back of the hot swap SSD - one molex (2nd on case) and SATA header. Due to my oversight I had to pull out the optical drive to make the connections to the headers. Obviously this won't happen on a second Stryker or Trooper build, but many folks only install one of these and the manual should of documented this more clearly. Again no big deal, it just takes more time to get it done.\n\nNot deal breakers. This is still the nicest case I ever used. However there is room for improvement and they could definitely update this 5+ year old design."

        "review": "There's a reason that mid-tower ATX cases were ubiquitous. Paying a little extra for a few features like a slide-out motherboard tray and removable drive cages really put you in a best-case scenario for assembling or working on the internals of your PC. You could even lay them on their sides and use them as desktop cases, and maintain all those advantages (ease of access to everything inside, easy to work on, etc.)\n\nThe CoolerMaster HAF XB EVO is a nice case. But it disappoints at almost every turn. At first glance it appears that it will have superb access to all the inner workings of your PC, but in practice, that's just not true. It also appears to be able to take the largest of the graphics cards, but that's not really true either.\n\nLet's start with the motherboard tray. It's removable, but you have to take the top panel and both side panels off, unscrew four thumb screws (which you can't really get at with your thumbs, so you're using a screwdriver anyway). Then you have to remove all of your expansion cards, and unplug EVERYTHING, and finally you can awkwardly tilt the whole tray/motherboard assembly just right - without dropping it - and avoiding smacking your HUGE CPU cooler on anything and wiggle it out the top of the case. That top opening looks huge until you try to get your motherboard out. The whole thing is tedious and awkward. Why they didn't have the motherboard slide out the back on a tray is beyond me.\n\nNext the division of the case into upper an lower decks seems to make sense and it certainly makes for a visually neat cabling view into the top of the case (though, I still don't know why people want to have the guts of their computer on display). But it causes everything on the lower deck to be almost inaccessible. The marketing info on this case says the drive cages are removable. And, yes, they can be removed, but not without a LOT of effort and completely removing almost everything else from the case. For instance: the left-side rear drive cage can only be removed if you remove the motherboard tray first so you can get at the screws. That's just plain bad design. Speaking of bad design: that same drive cage is big enough to hold 3 drives, but it can only hold two because they placed it wrong. There are two board-stand-offs above the cage that screw into the upper deck and just waste space, while the lower portion of the cage is inaccessible because of the rails that hold the side panel on. If the designer had flipped this cage, putting the stand-offs on the bottom (which would raise the cage), the full 3 drive capacity of the cage would have been available.\n\nLet's talk about \"tool-less design\" for a minute. I hate tool-less cases. Invariably they have cheap plastic one-off parts that if they ever break, you'll never get a replacement. And since they're cheap plastic, they break. All to replace a simple screw. If you instead made the drive cages removable - actually easily removable (not like this case) - putting a few screws in is no big deal. And shock of shocks: screws work really well, almost never break, and are easily replaceable. All of that brings us to the failure that is the front 5.25\" drive cage. Is it easily removable? No. Is it easily accessible? Yes! Is it tool-less? Not really. One side of the cage is tool-less. The other is not. Of course, that other tool-required side of the cage is completely inaccessible without removing everything but the kitchen sink. So, you're left with the decision of: should I just secure my 5.25\" drives on one side only with this cheap spring-loaded plastic thing or should I disassemble the whole world so I can get two screws into the other side of this cage? For an optical drive, securing them on one side (even with their cheap plastic crap) is generally sufficient. The drive slides in and snaps into place. But if you have any accessories that are not full sized 5.25 optical drives, like a front panel card reader or USB port expansion unit, since they don't go full depth, they will only engage one pin on the tool-less springy thing and will need to be secured on the other side with something (a screw). Why, oh why, CoolerMaster did you not just make the whole cage easily removeable?\n\nWell, how about those hot-swap drive bays? I do love me some hot-swap bays. But these are the cheapest implementation of hot-swap bays that I've ever seen. The swap doors are so cheap feeling and thin plastic, I just know they're going to break. And the ports on the back of the swap bay are some of the most frustrating to plug in SATA cables! Ugh. I think I lost a knuckle or two getting them connected. WHY ARE THE CONNECTORS POINTING STRAIGHT UP AT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE MOTHERBOARD?!? Why not have them point back toward the power supply?!? In an inspired moment of genius, the power connector socket is on a length of wire, so connecting that was super easy!\n\nNow lets talk about the elephant in the room: your graphics card. That shiny new RTX 3080 that you've waited years to get because of the chip/card shortage... It doesn't fit. OK, that's not completely true, you CAN get it in there, but not how you're thinking. You would think that you would just take the top panel off the case and drop your new GPU in there. Boom! Done! Not so fast. My Gigabyte RTX 3080 is 320mm long. The CoolerMaster case says it supports GPUs as long as 334mm. So you'd think it would just drop right in the top with 14mm to spare. NOPE. The top opening is about 5mm short to fit a 320mm card into. And because the card is so big and blocky, you can't angle it in from the top. You might be able to do so from the top if you remove the front fans and slid the card out through the fan hole as you drop it in - - - but in CoolerMaster's infinite wisdom the fans are screwed in from the INSIDE of the case. So once that GPU is in place, you're not getting to those screws, so you couldn't put the fans back (which is another horrible design choice - why aren't the fans attached from the outside?). But there is good news: if you remove the side panel and all of your other expansion cards, you can angle the CPU card in from the side and slide it into place and get it installed. That's certainly not ideal, but it's not bad, all things considered. I just hope reading this will keep someone from having their blood pressure spike when their GPU doesn't fit in the top like any normal human being would think it should when the case manufacturer says it will fit.\n\nLet's talk about this stupid bump on the top of the case. Why is it there? Is it to make sure that you can't ever put anything on top of the case so that you have a HUGE chunk of desktop real estate wasted with this monstrosity of a case? Is it so I can gaze lovingly down through the grill and look at all the dust accumulating on my expensive hardware? I don't know about those, but I do know that my CPU cooler barely fits and the bump in the top allows me to add another fan to the CPU cooler (Noctua NH-D15). The fan sticks up above my cooler because it is sitting on top of my RAM. Either way, the bump gives me a little more clearance. But it doesn't give me enough clearance to add a 200mm fan that the case is designed to use. It does beg the question: why make it a bump? It's ugly, inconvenient, and had to have more manufacturing cost that simply making the whole case 15mm taller.\n\nOK, let's give some praise where praise is due. Most of the case is high quality. The steel is not thin/bendy and the frame is stiff. All of the pieces/parts fit well together. The finish on the case is nice and did not instantly scratch up or show fingerprints all over it. It's not the ugliest case I've ever owned, but it is a far cry from the prettiest. It is way bigger than it needs to be, and that is only exacerbated by having to place it on top of my desk rather than hiding it under my desk.\n\nI think if this style case went through several generations of development, it could turn into a great case. But this design is immature, lacking in the refinement given from lots of feedback.\n\nOh, and if you believe the marketing-speak that you can use this case for a \"test bench\" computer, forget it. If I had to swap out parts in this case frequently, this case would end up like the FAX machine in the move \"Office Space\". Do NOT buy this for a test/bench PC.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this case to anyone. I can't think of who or what use-case scenario would be ideal for this case. If my video card would have fit in my old mid-tower case, I would go back to it in a heartbeat."

        "review": "When I purchased this case, I had never built a PC before. I'd also recently ended my 5-year career as an electrician to go to law school. I needed a hobby & a way to satisfy my need to build stuff. Well, I have gone to town on this case and loved it. Most of the black screws it came with are half silver from me taking it apart so many times. The case is big enough to be a sort of \"blank canvas\" for just about any configuration you can imagine, albeit with some limitations: I think it's a bit small for a 16mm OD PETG custom loop; I wish it had been designed to support bottom intake fans; and the top clearance for a 360mm AIO/radiator is too small for a push/pull configuration. Keep in mind if you continue to read, I am running an overclocked i9-10900K & need as much cooling capability as possible (with all case parts still properly attached, of course)\n\nThe stock 200mm fans look good and move a decent amount of air, but I replaced them with higher CFM (& IMO better-looking) Thermaltake Riing Trio 20s. Be mindful: the screw hole configuration for front 200mm fans is different from that for the TT 20s I put in. The stock CM 200s support two different screw layouts. Limited by the layout, I mounted the TT 20s diagonally with two screws & used double-sided adhesive foam to dampen any noise vibration might cause from the 2/4 screw mount. I haven't heard noise once.\n\nThere is no bottom fan support, but I was able to push some air up to the top AIO by cutting in a 2\" hole on the front HDD shroud & mounting a 120mm fan over the hole. I wish I didn't get an HDD since the rack is easily removable (& moveable btw), leaving ample space for more modification--might make some bottom fan support in the future, who knows?\n\nSimilarly, the case does not support mounting a radiator/AIO to the right of the motherboard, but the metal cover there is great for cable management and is also a good place to mount RGB/fan controllers &/or USB hubs out of sight. Further, a little drilling, a few washers, nuts, & 6-32s later, the metal cover is great for holding up my little Pikachu acrylic.\n\nThe vertical GPU mount is great, but know that--in my case, at least--the card will end up close to the glass, which may restrict air flow to the GPU fans. I have yet to have any issues with thermals, but I am also running a 3060 there, which is limited much more by its hardware than thermals. I also added a GPU support because the GPU sagged a bit and was slightly crooked when only connected to the vertical mount.\n\nWhen using a top-mounted 360mm AIO/radiator equipped with standard 120x120x25mm fans, the fit is tight. The back fan pushes harder against the 4+4 CPU power connections on my Aorus Z590 Ultra motherboard than I would prefer, but I have yet to experience any problems. If pushing against the cables worries you, be sure to check the dimensions on your AIO before purchasing or opt for a smaller AIO/radiator. I had this issue with both the CM ML360 & Arctic Liquid Freezer II.\n\nFurthermore, if you plan to top-mount an AIO/radiator, you cannot fit a push/pull configuration because of clearance issues with the CPU 4+4 connections. I tried mounting pull fans on top of the bracket to remedy this but even using 120x120x15mm slim fans, I could not close the top cover. Obviously, the front is mesh, but the top is acrylic with no mesh option available. Skeptical, I removed the top cover and averaged 5.5 degrees lower in stress tests. I assume this is because my AIO was able to expel exhaust heat much better. I don't recommend you do this, but I ended up taking a Sawzall to the top & removing most of the acrylic so I could fit some aRGB pull fans on top of the AIO. 120x120x15mm fans fit nearly flush with the top cover once the acrylic is out of the way. It snaps out if you do not want to cut it, but that leaves large holes where dust, etc. can get in & takes away from the look. If you go this route (for real, don't do it), you may want to buy grille guards since the fans will be much more exposed.\n\nYou can front mount an AIO/radiator. I tried it. The hoses probably will not be long enough to reach the CPU if you mount it connections down, and the HDD shroud will further complicate this. Hoses up will reach, but then you're left with the decision of whether to pick from either of two undesirable options. You can (a) flip your 200mms over to the ugly side & use the 200s as pull fans for exhaust and whatever fans the AIO/rad comes with as push fans. In this case, you'll be pulling hot air from inside the case to cool the liquid in the rad/AIO and taking away from the good looks of the case. Alternatively, you can (b) not flip the 200s & use them as push fans and use the AIO fans as pull fans. This blows hot exhaust air into the case. With no bottom fans, you're left with trying to use the top (restricted by acrylic plus hot air rises) or back (supports 1 140mm fan) as intake. I tried (b). I even mounted a 92mm fan on the PCI expansion area to try to push more air into the case. Thermals were bad. Mount your AIO/rad on top & save yourself the hassle.\n\nRegarding aRGB, the case comes with this little joke of a controller you can install to convert the computer reset switch to RGB control. I never even took it out of the plastic. Buy an aRGB controller unless you plan to connect the included 200mm fans directly to the aRGB header(s) on the motherboard. Some general advice (since no one asked): try to find a brand you like for aRGB & stick to it. At one point I had four different RGB apps and it's annoying."

        "review": "CoolerMaster is known for their durable, quality cases and the CM Storm Stryker is another tribute to that legacy.\n\nThis case is solid; beautifully painted with a thick coat of shiny white paint and steel thickness is about as solid as I have ever seen in any case in this price range ($149.99 on Amazon.com).\n\nThe side panels are a bit thinner metal but still seem to be very sturdy and not easily prone to bending or denting. The case overall is very sturdy and even the plastic parts are thicker and more sturdy than you'd expect to see on most cases in this price range; although the HDD bracket slide in holders are somewhat flimsy compared to the rest of the case quality. This case has a large, nicely designed side window that is rounded at the edges giving it a \"softer\" more elegant yet futuristic look, although I personally would rather not have black colored \"rivet\" type holders surrounding the edge of the window, preferring white to match the color of the case paint...(but that's just a personal opinion.) The side window is large enough to view your entire build but still covers the HDD stack. Just in front of and next to the side window is a nice size vent that will show your two white finned LED lit fans if you keep them positioned as they come out of the box: on the left side of the HDD stack rack. The right side panel also has a nice mesh vent as well. Speaking of ventilation, there is plenty of it and this case includes three easy to remove top (1) and bottom (2, front and back) dust filter that covers almost the entire length of the case; and two bottom slide out dust filters are easily accessible from the front and back undersides to slide out and clean.\n\nThe front control panel is nicely placed with a large lit on/off switch, two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, a nice fan speed/LED-on/off controller switch array and your mic and speaker in/out jacks and power reset button and associated power and HDD activity lights. What impressed me about this set up is that this panel is solid and fits as though it is actually built in to the top panel. Again, a very nice aesthetic design feature.\n\nThe business right side end of the case has lots of tie down hooks and plenty of well positioned, rubber grommet covered holes for cable connecting. There is what at first appears to be somewhat less space between the MOBO back plate and the back panel to accommodate the cables, however, notice that the right side panel is designed with a convex pushed out template allowing for plenty of clearance once the side panel is placed back on the case after your build is completed. Alas, no need to worry about a \"bulging\" bowed out side panel or issues with aligning it to secure back on to the case!\n\nThis case is also very well designed and sports impressive outer design features that are functional and pleasing to the eye. One unique feature on a case of this size is the soft, comfortable foam rubber handle on the top for easy lifting and moving. While I don't go to LAN parties, I still love this feature as much for making it much easier to carry out to the kitchen/porch to clean as also for the way the handle actually adds to the unique design of the case. Even though this case is rather heavy at a bit over 30 pounds (empty), the handle seems to be placed in a balanced centered position for even load weight distribution making lifting a less arduous task. The black highlighted, angled venting on top beginning at about the middle of the case and sloping down to the back is a very cool design feature giving the case a very futuristic yet stylish look and feel. In my opinion, the futuristic design elements are done with less flair and more elegance. This is a very thoughtful touch for those of us who prefer exotic yet subdued designs. When my wife comes in a looks at it and says \"Wow, that's a really awesome case!\" you know that it has passed the \"acid\" test for design and looks. The power and fan adjustment buttons and lights on top of the case are large, well placed and easy to use. Positioned directly under the top is an SSD slot which I think is a very nice feature design element.\n\nThe front black removable/optical drive covers are all easily removable by pushing in the side tabs, and upon closer inspection even have thin specially cut dust filters lined in each separate bay cover. The white angular side rails that butt up against the black removable drive covers give a really nice, sleek look to the front of the case and add a very nice contrast scheme to it.\n\nAnother unique feature is the name plate panel on the front bottom of the case. Upon removing this panel by simply pushing in the side tabs you'll find a hidden \"black box\" secured with two small screws that when removed reveals a nice plastic screw and parts case filled with more than enough screws, ties and a 12 volt MOBO extension cable. Replacing the parts box is a snap and does not require replacing the two small screws as it snaps in place by itself.\n\nTo top off how much detail was put into this case are four rounded rubber feet that are lined with a silver strip to add additional visual appeal.\n\nInside the case reveals just as much attention to detail and quality as the outside. There are two large removable and 90 degree \"rotatable\" HDD cages that are specifically designed for this case based on CM's long running HDD box cage concept. Four thumb screws hold these in place and once removed you can turn and rotate the cages to your design liking. There are two very nice white LED CM fans that are positioned facing the left side of the case. Again, these can be easily moved to the front or back or sides of the cages. You can mount 9 5.25 drives in this case and/or 8 3.5 inch or 13 2.5 inch drives. There are a lot of possibilities. On the back of the case are a white 120MM exhaust fan, 9 expansion slots allowing for 4 way SLI/CF configurations, a unique cable security slot lock bracket, your typical I\\O opening and PSU opening and three water cooling hose ports.\n\nGraphics cards can be as long as 12.7 inches and CPU cooler height can be as much as 7.3 inches...so this is a roomy case, albeit not such a tall or wide case as to be obtrusive in your den or gaming room. There are also four black back plates that hold the cages. These can also be removed and/or moved around and even completely removed to open up the entire front HDD drive end of the case for more air flow space, larger/longer GPU's, etc. There are also holes in the bottom for placement of additional cooling fans should you chose to use them.\n\nThe top of the case sports a white non-LED 200mm fan; when removed, you can replace it with two 120MM or two 140MM fans if desired. NOTE; I have seen a couple of other reviews on this case where the user complained that the top was nearly impossible to remove. This is not the case. DO NOT try and force-pull the top off!!! All you need to do is reach under the top metal flange where the plastic top sits and push in the six plastic tabs that hold the top on the case. There are three on each side running from front to back. Simply reach under and press in these six tabs and you'll see the top begin to pop open and then you can easily remove it. I really have no \"cons\" about this case other than my usual gripe about the poor quality of the user manual. The drawings are hard to read and understand and there is little written explanation for anything. Most any of us who would invest in a case like this would know how to unscrew and rotate the dive cage boxes and how to remove and turn the metal slide rail panels should you want to turn your front fans from the side to the front, etc. So, the poor quality of the user manual almost become a moot point, yet, we seem to see this same issue with all too many cases.\n\nI have owned Cooler Master cases in the past (such as the original Cosmos Sport, etc.) and have always been impressed with their quality and this case extends my positive attitude about CM and their attention to detail and design. Also. I am really quite impressed with all of the nice features this case has to offer for the very reasonable price of $149.99. I have personally seen several cases that are above the $200.00 range and do not come close to the quality, design and features this case has.\n\nMy build in this case was a breeze and a very enjoyable and fun experience. The case is quiet even on the highest fan settings and again looks really nice, especially in a low lit or dark room.\n\nI highly recommend this case for anyone that wants a truly well made, well designed gaming case that is pleasing to the eye, functional as is priced in a very affordable, feature rich package.\n\nPWN"

        "review": "I’ve just received this case – I’ve pulled it out of the box, but I haven’t started assembling my new computer. I’m still amassing the parts.\n\nBut I wanted to post a note here, partly for anyone considering purchasing this case, and partly for anyone with the Cooler Master corporation who might be reading these user reviews. There is a serious parts-availability problem with the current Cosmos line. This problem applies to the entire c700 series -- not just the c700p, which I purchased, but also the newer c700m. Read on and I will explain.\n\nWithout question, the Cosmos is one of the best-looking cases on the market. Everything about it screams “big and powerful.” The sleek lines, the aluminum handles at the top and bottom, and the curved tempered-glass side-panel make it a masterpiece of design. It’s a keeper. I can see myself swapping out parts as they become obsolescent, rather than buying a new case every time I build a new computer.\n\nThe Cosmos is really an iconic design. It always has been, from the original case to the current generation. Twenty years from now, when people look back on the computer hardware of our era, it will be the Cosmos that will be identified with the top-end computers of our day. I suspect this it will be regarded in the same way we see the Philco Predicta TV set of 1959-60. It looks as good when it’s turned off as when it’s on.\n\nOn initial inspection, I have noticed none of the fit-and-finish issues some users have complained of. I love the swing-out doorlike side panels, and the ability to use a non-standard layout. The exterior RGB strips on the current Cosmos line make this the perfect case for RGB builds. It’s about $100 more expensive than most full-tower cases, but I think the cost is justifiable.\n\nBut now my beefs. Cooler Master appears to recognize that the reason you buy a case like this one is to build a monster system. But not all of us who build systems like these plan to use water cooling. The reason we buy full-tower cases is so that we can install massive banks of hard drives. There isn’t enough room for a massive bank of hard drives AND a water-cooling system, so you have to choose one or the other. Personally, I have no intention of using water cooling, so this isn’t an issue for me.\n\nThe case offers the opportunity to install a large number of internal hard drives, using a bracket system. Terrific. I’ll be using six. But because Cooler Master assumes we’ll be using water cooling, the case ships with just two hard drive brackets. If you want more, you have to order them. (The part number is MCA-C700R-KOCC00.)\n\nBut just try to find them! As of this writing (Jan. 2019), the c700p has been on the market about 15 months, and I get the idea these brackets have never been made available through resellers in the U.S. The Amazon site says they are out of stock, and I doubt they have ever been “in.” At one point these brackets could be purchased through Cooler Master’s EU store, but they are sold out. I searched the entire English-speaking world, and I finally found a few at an Australian store that was willing to deal with overseas shipping. The cost was much higher than it should have been. If Cooler Master doesn’t get on the stick and stamp out some more, soon the entire world will be sold out.\n\nAlso, even though this is a case designed with RGB in mind, it ships with three plain-jane non-LED fans. You have to buy RGB fans separately. There are slots for up to 10 140mm fans – I will be using seven or eight. There is no problem finding RGB fans – they are made by many manufacturers, including Cooler Master. But I think Cooler Master is missing a bet by not shipping these cases with its own RGB fans. Anyone who builds a monster air-cooled RGB system will want to stuff the case with an RGB fan in every available slot. There are up to 10 slots available. (I’ll be using eight.) Since this is partly about looks, you’ll want every fan to match. If Cooler Master shipped this case with its own RGB fans, you’d be pretty well compelled to finish off the project with a few more Cooler Master RGB fans. As it is, you have to replace them all, so you might as well get them from any manufacturer.\n\nOne point worthy of note – all fan slots on this case accommodate either 140mm fans or 120mm fans. You might get the impression, from reading web reviews, that some of the slots accommodate only 120mm. Nope, all can take a 140mm fan.\n\nAlso, some web reviews indicate that there is only one 5.25 inch bay accessible from the front of the case. Nope, there are two. This is important if you want a system that will “do everything.” (I’ll be installing a Blu-Ray burner and a card reader/writer on the front panel.) Because of the way the front plastic panel lays over the front of the case, however, you need to be mindful of the fact that front-panel components cannot have protruding knobs.\n\nIn sum, this is a lovely case, with an iconic design that makes it suitable for years of use. When your motherboard and CPU become obsolete, you’ll probably reuse the case for your next system. Kudos to Cooler Master for redesigning this case and making it suitable for water-cooled systems. Unfortunately, Cooler Master seems to have given short shrift to those of us who plan to build systems the old-fashioned way, with air cooling and massive banks of hard drives. The problems are surmountable as long as parts can be sourced, but Cooler Master isn’t making it easy."

        "review": "This is a solid, well built budget rack mount server chassis. It's important to understand what you're getting here. So long as your expectations are appropriate, these chassis offer excellent value.\n\nFirst off, these are no SuperMicro. The target market is not enterprise companies. If you want a complete SYSTEM - and by that I mean, chassis, rails, etc. that all work together seamlessly - look elsewhere. But if you are willing to overlook a few potential warts, this is a great value.\n\nNow, let's first clarify some typical, appropriate use cases for this chassis. For starters, I bought the RSV-4500. This chassis comes with 8 fans and holds up to 15 3.5\" hard drives. The hard drive caddies are up front, and mean there's air being pushed across them, and then air is pulled across them as well by the next set of fans, located about 1/3 deep into the case (measured front to back). The distance between both sets of fans is ~9\". This leads me to suspect this amount of cooling is overkill for most disks, even with 5 of them per cage / per set of fans. The fans are 120mm.\n\nThere is a sister case, which is Rosewill model RSV-L4412U. The only difference between them is the RSV-L4412U model has 12 hot swap bays and is missing the 3 front-most 120mm fans found in the RSV-4500. The hot swap bays provided with the RSV-L4412U model are 3x RSV-SATA-Cage-34, a 4-bay 3.5\" drive cage made of plastic and have some questionable design characteristics. They retail on Amazon for ~$80 each + tax.\n\nIf a budget hot-swap rackmount chassis is your goal, the RSV-L4412U is an incredible bargain. If you were to purchase the RSV-4500 for example, and then purchase 3x of the Rosewill drive cages, you would spend substantially more money than if you simply bought the RSV-L4412U in the first place.\n\nIf you are more interested in getting the best overall combination of number of 3.5\" hard drives, hot swap drive capability, and a good quality chassis, you are better off going with the RSV-4500 and separately purchasing 3x 3.5\" drive cages manufactured by Norco or SuperMicro. Several independent tests have shown these drive cages to be among the best at keeping 3.5\" drives reasonably cool. Avoid Icy Dock. iStarUSA used to produce good quality drive cages, but their current offerings are either flimsy and/or have poor drive cooling, and should also be avoided if you would like to ensure your drives don't fail prematurely due to constant overheating.\n\nThere is one other option for a 15-drive bay setup. That is to go with the RSV-4500, not purchase hot swap drive cages, but remove the front fans. In this configuration, you still take advantage of the air filter built into the front of the flip down case fascia, and it is possible to position the drive inserts that come with the RSV-4500 case such that your SATA/SAS connection is facing rearward, while the clips to remove a drive and replace it when necessary are pointed forward. This will allow you to close the fascia and hide your bare drives, but access them easily when necessary. This approach is not for everyone, but it is a budget-conscious solution that will provide you with up to 15-drive bays in a well-cooled chassis, in spite of removing the front fans. With your drives installed in this manner, they will still be ~4\" from the 3x 120mm fans still installed in the case. For most people, with most hard drives, this will be more than adequate air flow to keep your drives reasonably cool.\n\nTo re-cap, there are several options for installing a good sized bank of 3.5\" drives in this case, and its design offers considerable flexibility.\n\nOne area that is a negative, is the documentation for the chassis is mediocre at best, and poor in some respects. For example, it fails to explain the fact that in order to depress the tabs that release the incumbent hard drive cages in the RSV-4500, you must first remove 1 or 2 screws for each cage that holds it in place. Once you have done so, the act of removing the drive cages requires one to simultaneously push down a couple of metal tabs on top of the drive cage, and apply force from the rear of the drive cage pushing it forward. Then, it will release out the front of the case. Furthermore, these acts require the removal (or at least sliding back) the top case cover. This latter point is noteworthy if you plan to install the chassis in a server rack and anything is installed directly above it. This, in turn leads me to my final point; the rails.\n\nI purchased the set of rails manufactured by Rosewill and compatible with this case. These rails are not included with your purchase of the chassis, which is a common issue with budget rackmount chassis.\n\nUnfortunately, the Rosewill rails use an old, rudimentary design that has fallen out of favor with most large, mainstream server chassis manufacturers, and for good reason. There are a lot of variety of server racks on the market now, and I found the Rosewill rail system would not install properly on my wall-mount server rack from StarTech. Specifically, the outer rail - where it wraps around the front and rear of a 4-post rack - was 1/8\" too wide. This resulted in a narrowing of the space between both inner rails of 1/4\", which was enough to make it impossible to install the Rosewill RSV-L4500 chassis in the server rack after attaching the inner rails to it and attempting to connect it with the middle rails on the rail system. Careful investigation after it became clear the unit was not going to fit into the rack revealed the flaw in the design of the Rosewill rails.\n\nI then experimented with a set of 3U/4U SuperMicro rails that use a more modern rail design, but I ran into the opposite problem. This combination resulted in an extra gap between the sides of the RSV-L4500 and the outer rails attached securely to the rack. I could have attempted the use of 5mm spacers, but this would have made the process more complicated by requiring 5mm longer screws. Furthermore, the rail screw holes in the SuperMicro inner rail did not align well with the side of the RSV-L4500 and it's pre-drilled rack rail mounting holes, meaning it would have been necessary to tap drill out multiple new threaded holes in the case for the purpose of utilizing the SuperMicro rail. In short, the LSV-4500 does not lend itself to universal rails (I also tried a set of StarTech rails, which also had alignment issues), due to the uncommon width of the server (it is rather narrow at 16.8\" wide). That being said, if your server rack is designed in such a fashion that the Rosewill rack rails are able to wrap around the edge of the server rails without pushing back into the interior of the rack, as was the case for me, then it may be an option for you.\n\nBottom line is this chassis is a solid budget choice, but it does have some drawbacks, depending on your needs. If you're willing to live with a bit of inconvenience and have a means to support it well enough in your rack (weight with all parts installed and 15 drives will be ~ 60-75 lbs.), it is a solid, economical choice for a large 3.5\" drive system for a home network NAS or media server. It's not perfect, but it is a good overall value.\n\nYMMV\n\n-------------------------------\n\nEDIT 01.14.2022:\n\nIn my original review, I inadvertently failed to clearly explain an important step if you wish to front-load your drives into the LSV-4500 case. It's a big enough pain that I should have provided more details in my original review, but here goes....\n\nThe LSV-4500 is designed such that you must insert and remove your drives from the rear of each of the three (3) groups of five (5) drives. That means in order to exchange a drive or install a new one you must do the following:\n\n1. Pull the chassis out of your rack.\n2. Remove the chassis lid.\n3. Release the drive cage and slide it partially forward.\n4. Reach to the back of the drive cage, pinch the tabs for the drive you need to remove, and slide the drive rearward.\n5. Remove the attached SATA and power cables.\nIn my original review, I mentioned there is an alternative approach where the drives may be mounted from the front. What I neglected to mention is this method involves minor hacking of the drive cages. Specifically, there are small, metal tabs toward the front of the drive cage, which are designed to stop you from accidentally sliding a drive too far forward and into the path of the front fan blades. So, if you want to be able to front-load your drives you will need to bend these tabs inward so they are flush with the inside side walls of the drive cage. It's not particularly difficult. This can be accomplished with a good set of ordinary pliers or a vice grip.\n\nA downside of front-loading your drives is it also means getting rid of the front mounted fans. There's really no point in keeping that in this configuration, as you'd have to remove them in order to get to the drives, defeating the purpose of having them be accessible from the front of the chassis. The upside is of course it means there's no need to remove the top of the chassis and manipulate the drive cage to remove or add a drive. You may think of this as a \"budget hot swap\" option if you like.\nPersonally, I don't recommend going that route, but if it suits your needs it is an option.\n\n<b>SuperMicro Drive Cage Swap</b>\n\nI've since found there is yet another option if you're interested in tinkering with the RSV-4500. It turns out that SuperMicro 5-disk mobile drive cages happen to fit very nicely in lieu of the stock drive cages. Remove the stock drive cages, insert the SuperMicro mobile drive cage with the LEDs at the top, and secure the SuperMicro cage with 2 screws on top and/or bottom. The cage will be firmly in place, and now you have just added 5 hot swap bays to your chassis.\n\nNext, you have a few possible configurations for this mod. You may then use the SuperMicro drive cage as a hot swap drive cage if you'd like. There is barely enough room to leave the 92mm fan on the rear of the SuperMicro drive cage in place, however I recommend removing it. I conducted some tests with an air velocity tester used by HVAC technicians to measure air speed and throughput, and I found with the SuperMicro 92mm fan blowing into a 120mm fan in the middle drive cage, it actually reduced the amount of air being pushed backward in the case (though I was not able to measure whether or not it improved the hydrostatic pressure). The problem is there's barely any space between the fans. You can move the middle fan rack back further by about 1/2\" via an extra set of screw holes in the side of the chassis, but either way we're talking about less than 2\" of clearance between both fans. Therefore, i recommend removing the SuperMicro 92mm fan from the back of the S.M. drive cage if you implement this design in your chassis. This also solves the problem of trying to route all your SATA cables from the back of the SuperMicro drive cage backplane to your motherboard without getting them in the way of the fans.\n\n<b>Other Information Tid-bits</b>\n\n1. You must use the stock drive cages if you want to use the front mounted fans. The fans are bolted into the fascia of the drive cages, and these are in turn designed to be recessed into the front of the case such that the locking front panel is able to close properly.\n2. There is an air filter built into the lockable front panel.\n3. The middle fan rack can be removed. It may also be adjusted very slightly by moving it back about 1/2\" in the chassis, by mounting it with an alternative set of holes on the side of the chassis."

My first introduction to them was for GPU mining a LONG time ago, if you are willing to remove the cross bar, secondary fan bar, and bays you could easily fit two E-ATX boards inside, or pack a bunch of GPUs on USB<->PCIE risers. The current design (2023) attaches the 120mm fans to the drive bays which is fine unless you plan on removing the drive bays (but want to have front-intake cooling.) These days we are buying them for gaming machines and studio/production workstations, we rack them in a cabinet from the center of the bullpen that exhausts into the attic space leaving our office space quiet and cool, the only cables coming out are 1xUSB and 1xDisplayPort per chassis. There is enough space to fit two radiators, but you may need to upgrade the case fans to exhaust the heat -- the stock fans are reasonably quiet, but the exhaust of the unit is maybe 60-70 cfm which is not enough when you have a 300-450watt GPU and 140-280watt CPU running at max, even with a climate-controlled cabinet/room with a proper barrier. For a typical backoffice server or JBOD box the stock cooling is more than adequate, and the secondary fan bar will actually ensure your drives aren't heat soaking. It's a decent chassis, and hard to beat the price. [10/10] will keep buying these 15 bay chassis for as long as Rosewill is profitable enough to make them :D"

        "review": "I replaced all of the internal fans with Noctua 80mm, and tbh...the sound difference isn't that minimal. I ended up reusing the stock fans in different parts of the case. I did two desktop conversions with these cases, and each worked out although the clearance between the onboard sata ports and the fan housing was so short, I had to remove that housing the get insert the sata cables (and I had to use differing directional angular connections (one up, one down) to fit one of the boards in. I managed to fit 8 drives (6 hdd, 2 sdd) in the drive bay area, but the gap between the drive bays and the motherboard enclosure is a bit small...fortunately, I installed a sas card with thin sata cabling (otherwise, they wouldn't have fit). Clearance between the drives and the fan enclosure is also a few mm too small...cabling coming out of the drives bends sharply against the fan grills (they're ultra thin too), and I ended up breaking one of them (finding out after reassembly...sigh). Being gentle helps there.\n\nThe one real gripe though, is that the psu compartment is too small for all of the psus I have. I got it to fit, but had to take out the mounting bracket as the psu length is an inch or so too long, so it's just wedged in there. The rails come out of the psu and run right into one of the 4 (optional) 80 mm fans, so I could only power the drives and fans off of the two rails that were far enough to the right to avoid that fan.\n\nYou will definitely need fan grills on all internal fans. The 80mm space in the rear doesn't have mounting wholes...do I used HVAC tape. It might sound janky, but its stable.\n\nZip ties area your friend as well at keeping cabling in order. I also ended up getting a Noctua low profile cooler to replace the typical monster sized desktop ones. I had to bend it a bit to get it to clear the ram, and still fit inside the 2U enclosure. Had to remove the ram heat sync's as well, but that Noctua was so large it covered the ram as well, so...I suppose that's a little bit of a positive side effect.\n\nNote to self: never throw away low profile card brackets...the generic ones I ended up using don't really fit the cards.\n\nIn total, it was worth the conversion, although with a 10G and SAS card installed. Drives are the same temperatures as they were in the desktop case (29c-35c) even under continuous load. It took a lot of hours though to get things in and fitting...taking things apart when they dont fit and re-routing cables. The second time around though had a much more clean looking result.\n\nI don't use rails...my rack has three shelves in place as-is, so they're just stacked (bolted, with spaces on the back side for the same clearance I would have gotten with rails)\n\nI think I will go for a 3U or 4U next time just for better clearances for cabling, and more GPU options (which I didn't have for these conversions)."

One of the hot swap bays/modules in my RSV-L4412U is bad, and tech support ignored my email and the phone line hung up on me. Where can I get a spare?\n\nI would advise against getting this unless Rosewill demonstrates publicly that they respond.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAlso this case came with 3 faulty SATA cables. I didn't even attempt to RMA these, I simply used spares I had on hand.\n\nDon't call, their phone number in the manual, simply hangs up after a few minutes on the phone and provides no option to hold. The email in the manual techsupport@rosewill.com looks like it words and their people can check it, but they don't somehow this gets ignored.\n\nTo get a response use RMA@Rosewill.com and even then take response with a grain of salt because they have crap internal communication.\n\nThe spare part number for the hot swap module is: RSV-SATA-Cage-34\n\nThere are retail and RMA versions of this part. I am not clear on the exact difference, but RMA representatives promised me a replacement in 1-2 business 2 weeks ago and I never received any update after that, then I learned they were out of the RMA version. To be fair to them they said there might be other delays but I expected some communication, and that team ghosted me.\n\nEventually a Rosewill representative did call me but only because of this review. They wanted to make whole situation right and offered me the retail version of the part. This rep explained the inventory difference, was puzzled about the non-responses I got but recorded (and verified them, I had all the ID numbers and timestamps). I suspect this is a different team that is less dysfunctional.\n\nDon't use this case unless you have a very reliable checksumming system on your data. I am using ZFS and its checksumming was key in identifying the faulty cables and faulty hot swap module. It is still cheap for what it is, the next cheapest solution is north of double the price. So if you can reliably find silent data errors and have a willingness to troubleshoot this can be made to work.\n\nI moved this to two stars, for now. Since my complaints are mostly around service if I do get the replacement cage I will move this review to 4 stars, because it is now clear they are trying but have crap systems in place now. I can't give 5 stars, it has been more than a month in total and they still haven't gotten me a spare.\n\nUpdate 2\n\nThis review resulted in a call to me, that resulted in a replacement for the faulty part being shipped to me. This took far too long and critical mismanagement like this is part of why I was avoiding NewEgg. Amazon isn't great but at least they respond, and now this replacement shows up in a NewEgg box?! Like they are proud of this level of service. If I had known newegg was involved. I wouldn't have ordered this to begin with.\n\nI had been boycotting newegg because of them having ripped me off a few times and likely criminal levels of shenanigans. I can't go higher than 3 stars knowing this put money into the hands of people I specifically chose not to. I don't think I will be ordering anything from NewEgg or Rosewill for several years and if you do be ready for a hassle if anything goes wrong."

        "review": "Building a new PC over the past month, I first thought of Corsair for a case. But I was disappointed to find that neither Corsair - nor any other manufacturer - seems to be making full-size cases any more that have room for a proper optical (DVD-ROM) drive.\n\nThen I discovered Phanteks, a maker I'd never heard of before. Glad I did! Despite the weird nomenclature the Phanteks Enthoo Pro turns out to be a great PC case, with solid construction and all the features I wanted. Construction is solid steel - and I mean SOLID. This case weighs a ton, it's built like a tank. But it's cavernously roomy and extremely well thought-out.\n\nThere's a 200mm fan at the front and a 140mm one at the back, plus a mesh top for water cooling radiators. All vents have removable dust screens. There's a proper rack for disk drives, with three externally accessible bays for optical drives or things like fan controllers. Sections of the drive cage can be removed to allow for extra-long video cards. There are several separate mount locations for SSDs.\n\nIt's easy to build neatly in the Enthoo. The power supply, at the bottom of the case, gets its own removable metal covering. The back of the case ('behind' the motherboard) has a plethora of little Velcro tie-downs, making it easy to route wiring. I mounted a Corsair iCue H150i radiator at the top of the case, with three 120mm fans - no problem, all the screw holes fit perfectly, and there was oodles of room to spare. (Double check me on this, but I'm pretty sure I could have gone to four 140mm fans.) The plastic top and front of the case are easily removable, a huge help to accessibility.\n\nI put a big ASUS Rog Crosshair VIII Dark Hero motherboard in the case with absolutely no problem. Mounting an AMD CPU doesn't need it, but the case has a huge cut-out for rear access to Intel-style cooler mounts. Everything went together smoother than on any of my previous builds.\n\nThe front of the case has a built-in port panel, with USB and audio ports. A flip-up cover conceals this and keeps dust out when the ports aren't in use. I like the modest clear panel - I've got the Corsair lighting programmed to give me a reading on temperatures. However, one thing the Enthoo Pro lacks is venting for a side-mounted radiator.\n\nThere are lots of bonuses. The manual is good, with lots of diagrams. All the screws you'll need (and then some) are shipped in a nice plastic box with little compartments in it. This case is a class act all the way.\n\nOne caution: the newer Enthoo 2 adds a few nice features (such as room for a front-mounted radiator), but DROPS the optical-drive bays. If that matters to you, you might want to do as I did and snap up the original Enthoo Pro in a hurry. I don't think you'll regret it."

Huge fan in the front and 120mm fan in the back moves lots of air for cooling. My new CPU cooler has 2 fans as well so I'm not worried about overheating at all. Vents have filters, which is nice.

Solid steel construction (very sturdy and heavy), no RGB nonsense to inflate the price, plenty of space for whatever you want to throw into it and space to rout your wires and allows for installation of optical drives (which is getting rarer every year and was one of the initial selling points that drew me to this case). The 2 included fans are fine (but I personally added 2 fans on the top grate for additional cooling, it really depends on how much heat the components you use generate). This is the best value for money case I have ever used and I would buy it again if I ever have to build a PC for someone else I know.\n\nInteresting to note, the first 2 Enthoo Pros I bought included: 2 USB 3.0 slots and 2 USB 2 slots on the front panel, but the 3rd one I bought included: 2 USB 3.0 slots and 1 USB C charging port (no USB 2 slots), I assume they changed the design of their front panel in the last year to modernize it. So keep this in mind when buying. Otherwise it was identical to the other 2 cases and of the same build quality.\n\nNo flashy/tacky nonsense that will look dated in 6 months, it just works, has a classic look and doesn't look like a piece of tacky trash that was dug out of Optimus Prime's chest cavity."

Chassis is sturdy enough, but drive cages are flimsy (screwless plastic) and aren't suited well for 2.5\" SSDs. The side mount is better but too tight to the side panel making it difficult to route power and SATA Ribbons. MB mount plate had standoff holes in exactly the right places for my MSI board. Standoffs are black painted or chromed? I prefer bright brass standoffs in case one drops in the black case.\nPCI-e lines up well, and had plenty of room for a 3090 inside. There shouldn't be any trouble connecting large GPUs in this case.\n\nSide covers are easy to remove, and provide good access to internals. 2 finger screws hold each in place securely.\n\nIncluded fans were poorly centered, flimsy. I would have liked a version with no fans for a little less money.\nAll fans were replaced with Noctua industrial fans. It's large and vented on 4 sides; so good airflow is needed to avoid hotspots. No less than 5 high cfm fans recomended on an air cooled setup. This is not a quiet case, but far from the noisiest; it really depends on fan/hw selection quite a bit.\n\nFront covers, fan covers, external plastic parts feel solid/tight.\nPower button Is a big negative: It wobbles when pressed, colored the same (black) as the rest of the case, and a little too small. A silver or minimally backlit 1.5cm round button that doesnt wobble would have been nice.\n\nFront panel with extra ports/audio/restart button works well.\n\n-The case weighs a ton. It actually cracked the wood table I put it on! Feels like 90 pounds filled.\n\n-Came well packed for shipping\n\nI recommend it as a full sized, basic enclosure.

Most I didn't need but it is great for any future needs. It is also in a nice plastic tray with a solid lid and they are not all tossed into a bag.\n\nThe power button is in a very convenient place.\n\nThe mobo standoffs were already installed, which is nice. It is often a headache to put them in. It is just the standoffs needed for an ATX board that are installed but it comes with extras if you are putting in an E-ATX board.\n\nCons:\n\nThe glass side panel is a worthless thing That likely adds to the expense.\n\nThe manual says that it is supposed to have 2 SSD trays but it only shipped with one. I contacted them, and the timeliness and accuracy of their reply will move the rating up or down. Edit: I emailed them on a Sunday evening, and they responded Tuesday morning asking for my invoice - totally reasonable - and within an hour I got a notification that it was being shipped.\n\nThe SSD tray is clunky. It should not require screws. It is nearly impossible to solidly screw the SSD in with 4 screws. It is also difficult to squeeze the SATA power cables through the slot.\n\nThe no-tool 5.25\" bays do not work. It did not solidly clip my Bluray player in and required two screws.\n\nThe weird PWM controller is worthless and a potential point of catastrophic failure, and adds more to the cost. Losing the CPU fan to an untrustworthy addition is just asking for trouble. Luckily, it can be easily ignored and the fans plugged into the mobo like the nerd gods intended. It would have been better to ditch that and add an additional fan.\n\nThe reboot button is not in a convenient place.\n\nThe cover on the front USB ports is annoying.\n\n----\n\nIt is probably my fault, but even all of the features to manage cabling don't help much if you are like me and have multiple SATA drives. That is not a pro or con.\n\nOverall, there are no serious complaints and it feels like it will last a very long time."

I like to tinker with my case and swap parts in and out a lot, so the bigger the case the better.\n\nThis case is built well and is mostly metal. The frame and most panels are screwed on rather than riveted, so it's easy to take it apart when building in it. You can customize it to make room for liquid cooling if you want, or you can keep the optical drive bays installed if you still prefer using DVD and CD ROMs.\n\nI have two optical drives, two SATA 'traditional' hard drives and there's still room for a plug-in SSD drive in there. I do also have an SSD drive, but it is the new NVME style that plugs into the motherboard.\n\nThere is room for a full-sized ATX motherboard and you still have room for a three-fan graphics card. I currently have a one-fan graphics card installed myself because it used to be in much smaller case. If GPU prices stop being crazy someday, I might upgrade the GPU.\n\nThe fan situation is amazing. It comes with a 200mm fan in the front and a 140mm fan in the back. There's room for either 120 or 140mm fans in the top and bottom of the case that you can add later. The brackets in the top and bottom will hold both sizes of fans. The Phanteks website says that the top of the case will hold three 140mm fans. I have three 120mm fans in it now. The front of the case can be modified to hold two 120 or 140mm fans instead of the 200mm fan if you want. Neither of the fans that come with the case light up.\n\nIn the other side of the case, there is room for cable management. It's the first case that I've owned that has this as well as the fan in the bottom. It's nice to be able to access the back side of the motherboard and to route most of the cables back there, making the other side with the window look neater. There's also a fan hub back here in which you can plug up to five fans (more if you use cable splitters). Then, you plug one more wire from the sixth spot on the hub into the 'Pump' power fan connector on your motherboard. That way, all of your case fans are controlled by the same controller on the motherboard and work together without having to have fan wires all over the main bay of the case. One bad thing about this hub though is that it can be a little tricky to remove wires once you plug them in. I accidentally damaged one of the brackets in the hub while trying to remove the wire. I got the wire to stay in by taping over it with electrical tape though.\n\nThe bay where the hard drives go is in the other side of the case opposite the window, so it hides them and leaves more room in the main bay. Air from the front and top of the case still flows through here though, so they won't overheat. The little brackets that you screw the drives into are easy to work with. Much easier than the bays in my previous cases.\n\nAnother thing that is much easier to deal with in this case than in previous cases I've owned, is the front bezel. It, along with the top of the case, snaps on and off easily making cleaning much easier. This is important since one of the dirtiest parts of a case can be where the air gets sucked into it.\n\nSpeaking of dust, this case tries harder to keep dust out than other cases I've had. It has screens in the front bezel, top bezel, and the bottom of the case to catch most of the stuff that tries to get in. The screens are easy to wipe off when you remove them. The ones in the bottom are in pull-out trays, so you can clean them without having to lay the case on its side.\n\nThis is a big case, so be sure that you have plenty of room for it on your desk. Also be sure that your desk is sturdy because by the time you finish building in it, it will be quite heavy.\n\nOne little issue with it is that once I finished building it and started using it, I noticed that after I had removed the windowed side panel a couple of times, it started rattling when the fans were running full blast. I tried all sorts of things. Finally, putting a thin piece of foam that came with the computer case (probably to keep parts from rubbing together) under the middle leg on the left side. That seems to have solved it for now.\n\nSpeaking of the bottom and the legs, be sure when you are using the case, to not sit it on carpet, nor to block the bottom of the case with anything since it is one of the ways that fresh air gets in the case, especially after you install a fan in the bottom. When you put a fan in there, be sure to have the back side (or ugly side) of the fan motor showing inside the case so that the fan will draw air into the case rather than blowing it out.\n\nIt's by far the best case I've owned and for a great price too."

        "review": "I've built many (tower) personal computers, dating back to the first Intel 386 architecture. This is the nicest case I've worked with. It is large, and as such takes some effort to move around, and the feet are good... they prevent the unit from sliding around too much on a hard surfaced floor.\n\nThe case is wide enough that the bulk of any point-to-point wiring can be hidden behind the internal motherboard mounting plate, and there are lots of hook-loop straps attached on the back side to tie down the wiring very nicely. The motherboard mounted and everything lined up perfectly... from all the mounting holes to the rear panel connectors. The top is open enough to house a 3-fan liquid cooler radiator and fans, the case fan on the back (140mm) is mounted in slots so its height is adjustable to allow for such top mounted coolers. The front mounted 200mm case fan does a nice job blowing air over the 3.5\" HDD bays. There's room for 6 3.5\" drives, up to 3 5.25\" drives and a bracket for a 2.5\" SSD.\n\nWhat I found was that it's not easy to find tower cases with 5.25\" bays for things like DVD/BD readers/writers. This was a \"must have\" for me, as although I put gaming hardware in the box, I use it for some other intensive video rendering work.\n\nOnly a couple of (minor) negatives. The acrylic or polycarbonite \"windows\" in the side panel can be easily scratched... I suggest leaving the protective sheet on until you're finished with your build. I don't care for the lift-up door to access the front-panel connectors... you have to bend down to below the level of the little door to see the connectors.\n\nOverall, for the price, this is an excellent case for a \"business computer\" build. Plenty of room for the power supply, lots of drives, even ATXe motherboards and handles liquid cooling components nicely. If you're going to do a custom liquid cooler that has a reservoir, there's even a reservoir bracket that you can mount inside the case. I'd buy it again if I were to do another build-out."

        "review": "This is a great unit that fits all my rackmount equipment perfectly. Much nicer having it all locked in to a cube like this. Easy to move and looks great. The only thing I don’t like is the backwards lean on the unit as a whole. Kind of wish it was straight/flush up and down but it’s only a minor complaint for me.\n\nOne star loss as the unit came defective right out of the box. One of the screw holes on the bottom left didn’t line up with the nut and I completely stripped it trying to screw it in with a power drill (literally the only way to get it started/on). It’s not a huge deal as the screw went in far enough to keep the unit together and stable but still, kind of a letdown. In the end though, I paid a fraction of the cost of other rack units out there but wonder if I could have just made something similar for a fraction of even its cost (with a little hunting at a big-chain hardware store or something).\n\nEither way, a great unit that now houses my (exactly 8 units) all in one nice, tidy little package."

It is not mentioned in the instructions or seen in the product photo here, but it's there, and you won't need any instructions to see how it attaches.\n\nThe only problem I've had with this is if you need to rack something full length like a server, it can't go in the bottom U because it is tilted just enough that the back-end of your device will hit the ground. Anything half-length like most routers you might be using will work there just fine though. Overall I still give it 5 stars because it's very sturdy and in my opinion very good value."

New-ish AAA game titles (specifically for me \"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands\" ) are now requiring a MINIMUM of 8gb of VRAM, so I decide to get a new card with ray tracing (which is a waste because \"Portal RTX\" is only for freaking expensive Nvidia cards, not cheaper AMDs).\n\nIt arrives, but is too long for my original case because, you know, MEASURING IS A GOOD THING that is easily forgotten in the throes of \"ooh new, modern and shiny!\" shopping sprees.\n\nAfter some research, reading and watching reviews, I decide on this case.\n\nThree days of struggling, swearing and constant insert/remove video card due to troubleshooting later, my husband and I find out that my tower is defective.

There are a lot of features packed into this compact case, which would also make it a good choice for someone building a computer for the first time. My main complaint is the panel that covers where the cables go around to the back almost always has to slide to the second position. I had to do this both times because there was no other way that my 24-pin cable could fit through the gap at such a sharp angle. Now the cables in the back are visible. Another thing to consider is that if you're using PSU cable extensions, a non-modular PSU, and RGB controllers, then that HDD bay probably won't fit. Quality is quite good overall. The only place where it falls short is the bracket that holds the three fans on the side is a bit flimsy. Anyways, bought twice and happy with it both times. Comes with plenty of screws, zip ties, and two 3-pin fans."

Voici ce que j'en pense en quelques points:\n\n----------- Design & Finitions :----------------\nLe boîtier offre une esthétique sobre et orientée Gamer, notamment avec le verre trempé qui permet d'exposer les composants internes du PC. C'est sans doute l'une des raisons principales pour lesquelles j'ai choisi ce modèle. Aussi il y a une version avec vitre avant ou avec grille, celle avec une grille a un meilleur airflow, mais j'ai investi sur un bon kit de refroidissement et j'ai pris le boitier avec une vitre avant car il est plus esthétique pour moi.\n\n------------- Éclairage RGB: ---------------\nLe système d'éclairage iCUE de CORSAIR ne déçoit jamais! J'ai pu personnaliser l'éclairage selon mes besoins et il est très facile à utiliser, et il se marie parfaitement avec le reste de mon setup.\n\n---------------Air Flow:-------------\nJ'utilise plusieurs ventilateurs et le boîtier est conçu pour permettre une circulation d'air optimale. Même pendant les sessions de jeu gourmandes, ce qui est un gros plus pour moi.\n\n--------------Espace & Modularité:-----------------------\nBien que qualifié de \"moyen tour\", le 4000X offre suffisamment d'espace pour tous mes composants, et j'apprécie vraiment sa modularité qui m'a permis de gérer facilement le cable management.\n\n------------Facilité d'installation: ---------------\nLe montage a été un jeu d'enfant. Tous les emplacements sont clairement identifiés et accessibles.\n\nCependant, rien n'est parfait. J'aurais aimé avoir peut-être quelques passages de câbles supplémentaires ou des options de personnalisation (quelques câbles restes bien visibles sur les photos), mais ce sont des détails mineurs au vu de la qualité générale de ce boîtier.\n\n---------------Conclusion :------------------\nJe recommande vivement le CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB à quiconque cherche un boîtier PC alliant esthétique, performance et qualité de construction. Je recommande vivement !"

Here's my unbiased review of this product.\n\nPros:\n\nStunning RGB Lighting: The RGB lighting on this case is a showstopper. The three included SP120 RGB Elite fans illuminate your PC with vibrant, customizable colors. The iCUE software allows you to sync the lighting with other Corsair peripherals, creating a visually cohesive gaming or work environment.\n\nExcellent Build Quality: The case feels solid and well-constructed. The tempered glass side panel provides a clear view of your components, and it's easy to remove for maintenance or upgrades.\n\nGreat Cable Management: Corsair has designed this case with cable management in mind. There are plenty of cable routing channels and tie-down points, helping you achieve a clean and organized interior.\n\nAirflow: Despite the emphasis on aesthetics, Corsair hasn't compromised on airflow. The front panel has a mesh design that allows for adequate ventilation, keeping your components cool even during demanding tasks.\n\nSpacious Interior: The 4000X offers ample space for ATX motherboards and high-end GPUs. It also supports multiple storage options, including SSD trays and HDD cages.\n\nEasy Installation: Installing components in this case is a breeze, thanks to the well-thought-out layout. The tool-free drive bays and PCIe slot covers make the build process smoother.\n\nCons:\n\nPrice: While the features and quality are top-notch, the price point may be a bit high for some users. However, considering the included RGB fans and overall build quality, it's a reasonable investment for enthusiasts.\n\nLimited Radiator Support: If you plan on using a large liquid cooling setup, the radiator support might be a bit limited, especially at the front. You'll need to ensure that your chosen components fit within the case's dimensions.\n\nIn summary, the CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX PC Case is an outstanding choice for gamers and PC enthusiasts who prioritize aesthetics without sacrificing functionality. It offers a stunning RGB lighting experience, excellent build quality, and efficient cable management. While it comes at a premium price, it's a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to showcase their PC components in style."

Avec ses ventilateurs avant RGB qui illuminent subtilement mon espace de jeu, il ajoute une touche esthétique incomparable à ma configuration. Mais ce n'est pas que de l'apparence ! Ce boîtier offre une expérience d'installation et de gestion de câbles exceptionnelle.\n\nL'un des points forts incontestables de ce boîtier est sa facilité d'installation des composants. Les emplacements parfaitement conçus permettent de monter les cartes graphiques, les disques durs et les alimentations sans aucun tracas. Même pour quelqu'un comme moi, qui n'est pas un expert en assemblage de PC, l'expérience a été fluide et sans embûches.\n\nLa gestion des câbles est un autre aspect remarquable. Grâce aux passages intelligemment placés, j'ai pu dissimuler habilement tous les câbles disgracieux, offrant ainsi un aspect soigné et bien organisé à l'intérieur du boîtier. Cette fonctionnalité s'est avérée essentielle pour maintenir une circulation d'air optimale et garder mon système au frais pendant de longues sessions de jeu intenses.\n\nLes vitres latérales et en façade ajoutent une touche de transparence qui met en valeur l'ensemble de ma configuration. C'est un plaisir de pouvoir admirer mes composants et de montrer fièrement mon travail d'assemblage. Corsair a vraiment pensé à tout pour offrir aux utilisateurs un spectacle visuel incroyable, à l'intérieur comme à l'extérieur du boîtier.\n\nMais ce n'est pas seulement une question d'apparence. La qualité de construction du boîtier est exceptionnelle. Les matériaux robustes utilisés inspirent confiance et je sais que mes composants sont entre de bonnes mains. Le boîtier offre également une excellente isolation phonique, ce qui réduit considérablement le bruit de fonctionnement de mes composants, offrant ainsi une expérience de jeu plus immersive et agréable.\n\nEn résumé, le boîtier PC Corsair avec RGB et vitres latérales est un véritable bijou de technologie et de style. Il allie parfaitement le design moderne avec des fonctionnalités pratiques, comme une installation facile des composants et une gestion de câbles ingénieuse. Les vitres ajoutent une touche visuelle impressionnante, tandis que la qualité de construction assure une durabilité à toute épreuve. Si vous cherchez à donner un coup de boost à votre setup gaming tout en restant fidèle à la qualité, ce boîtier est un choix incontournable. Corsair a vraiment frappé fort avec ce modèle, et je ne peux que le recommander à tous les passionnés de PC qui veulent un boîtier à la hauteur de leurs attentes les plus élevées."

        "review": "I had a prebuilt I bought a long time ago that I basically have upgraded into a new PC over the years. The only thing I haven't replaced is the case by this point. My old case wasn't awful, but it began to fall apart, and I always wanted a white PC case so I decided to give in and get this one! I don't regret it at all so far. It was really easy to set up, and the cable management is way better than other cases I have worked with (I have worked on a few PC's for my brother and friends as well). I also love how this case is a mid sized tower, but somehow has so much room? I found it much easier to work with compared to my old case, which was a large sized tower. Everything is really easy to remove and put back together, and it came with extra zip ties, velcro strips, and screws for fans and screwing in the motherboard, which is super nice. The only thing that I noticed was it doesn't fit a 140mm fan at the back of the case, which is what I had in my old case (this is user error, I didn't double check this. Just wanted to mention in case anyone might be unaware too). But the case came with two simple black 120 mm fans so I just used one of those no problem. It looks great and I am super happy with it!"

I like the cable management, that was well thought-out!\n\nOh, what a saga. New-ish AAA game titles (specifically for me \"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands\" ) are now requiring a MINIMUM of 8gb of VRAM, so I decide to get a new card with ray tracing (which is a waste because \"Portal RTX\" is only for freaking expensive Nvidia cards, not cheaper AMDs).\n\nIt arrives, but is too long for my original case because, you know, MEASURING IS A GOOD THING that is easily forgotten in the throes of \"ooh new, modern and shiny!\" shopping sprees.\n\nAfter some research, reading and watching reviews, I decide on this case.\n\nThree days of struggling, swearing and constant insert/remove video card due to troubleshooting later, my husband and I find out that my tower is defective. The top power button and USB ports don't work, but the restart button does.\n\nMy husband tried the power switch from an old case he had, and that one worked, so yes, there is a defect. Oh well, at least my system turns on and works nicely now with new large-capacity SSDs and a faster, better video card in a well-ventilated case."

        "review": "I liked building two computers using this white case. There are a lot of features packed into this compact case, which would also make it a good choice for someone building a computer for the first time. My main complaint is the panel that covers where the cables go around to the back almost always has to slide to the second position. I had to do this both times because there was no other way that my 24-pin cable could fit through the gap at such a sharp angle. Now the cables in the back are visible. Another thing to consider is that if you're using PSU cable extensions, a non-modular PSU, and RGB controllers, then that HDD bay probably won't fit. Quality is quite good overall. The only place where it falls short is the bracket that holds the three fans on the side is a bit flimsy. Anyways, bought twice and happy with it both times. Comes with plenty of screws, zip ties, and two 3-pin fans."

Temps only reach 68c with an overclock to 5ghz and with the 3060 running the case doesnt really get that loud at all, when idle its really hard to hear it, i can only slightly hear the sound of my AIO.\nDefinitly can reccomend this case, Not sure if it can fit 40 series cards though like the 4090 but it fits my MSI 3060 Gaming x gpu, i also built a second pc and it was easy to install a micro atx aswell.\nThe only con id say is the fact there is only 1 usb port at the front but that doesnt bother me since my rear IO has like 8 ports and my keyboard has USB passthrough.\nI recomend buying the one with the fans, the one without rgb fans isnt really my favourite since its only controlled via voltage since it is only a 3 pin. Also they could make more room to more comfortably install a commander core XT but i managed to stuff it in there at the back."

        "review": "Après plusieurs mois d'utilisation, je suis vraiment impressionné par le boîtier CORSAIR. Voici ce que j'en pense en quelques points:\n\n----------- Design & Finitions :----------------\nLe boîtier offre une esthétique sobre et orientée Gamer, notamment avec le verre trempé qui permet d'exposer les composants internes du PC. C'est sans doute l'une des raisons principales pour lesquelles j'ai choisi ce modèle. Aussi il y a une version avec vitre avant ou avec grille, celle avec une grille a un meilleur airflow, mais j'ai investi sur un bon kit de refroidissement et j'ai pris le boitier avec une vitre avant car il est plus esthétique pour moi.\n\n------------- Éclairage RGB: ---------------\nLe système d'éclairage iCUE de CORSAIR ne déçoit jamais! J'ai pu personnaliser l'éclairage selon mes besoins et il est très facile à utiliser, et il se marie parfaitement avec le reste de mon setup.\n\n---------------Air Flow:-------------\nJ'utilise plusieurs ventilateurs et le boîtier est conçu pour permettre une circulation d'air optimale. Même pendant les sessions de jeu gourmandes, ce qui est un gros plus pour moi.\n\n--------------Espace & Modularité:-----------------------\nBien que qualifié de \"moyen tour\", le 4000X offre suffisamment d'espace pour tous mes composants, et j'apprécie vraiment sa modularité qui m'a permis de gérer facilement le cable management.\n\n------------Facilité d'installation: ---------------\nLe montage a été un jeu d'enfant. Tous les emplacements sont clairement identifiés et accessibles.\n\nCependant, rien n'est parfait. J'aurais aimé avoir peut-être quelques passages de câbles supplémentaires ou des options de personnalisation (quelques câbles restes bien visibles sur les photos), mais ce sont des détails mineurs au vu de la qualité générale de ce boîtier.\n\n---------------Conclusion :------------------\nJe recommande vivement le CORSAIR iCUE 4000X RGB à quiconque cherche un boîtier PC alliant esthétique, performance et qualité de construction. Je recommande vivement !"

        "review": "This is a solid, well built budget rack mount server chassis. It's important to understand what you're getting here. So long as your expectations are appropriate, these chassis offer excellent value.\n\nFirst off, these are no SuperMicro. The target market is not enterprise companies. If you want a complete SYSTEM - and by that I mean, chassis, rails, etc. that all work together seamlessly - look elsewhere. But if you are willing to overlook a few potential warts, this is a great value.\n\nNow, let's first clarify some typical, appropriate use cases for this chassis. For starters, I bought the RSV-4500. This chassis comes with 8 fans and holds up to 15 3.5\" hard drives. The hard drive caddies are up front, and mean there's air being pushed across them, and then air is pulled across them as well by the next set of fans, located about 1/3 deep into the case (measured front to back). The distance between both sets of fans is ~9\". This leads me to suspect this amount of cooling is overkill for most disks, even with 5 of them per cage / per set of fans. The fans are 120mm.\n\nThere is a sister case, which is Rosewill model RSV-L4412U. The only difference between them is the RSV-L4412U model has 12 hot swap bays and is missing the 3 front-most 120mm fans found in the RSV-4500. The hot swap bays provided with the RSV-L4412U model are 3x RSV-SATA-Cage-34, a 4-bay 3.5\" drive cage made of plastic and have some questionable design characteristics. They retail on Amazon for ~$80 each + tax.\n\nIf a budget hot-swap rackmount chassis is your goal, the RSV-L4412U is an incredible bargain. If you were to purchase the RSV-4500 for example, and then purchase 3x of the Rosewill drive cages, you would spend substantially more money than if you simply bought the RSV-L4412U in the first place.\n\nIf you are more interested in getting the best overall combination of number of 3.5\" hard drives, hot swap drive capability, and a good quality chassis, you are better off going with the RSV-4500 and separately purchasing 3x 3.5\" drive cages manufactured by Norco or SuperMicro. Several independent tests have shown these drive cages to be among the best at keeping 3.5\" drives reasonably cool. Avoid Icy Dock. iStarUSA used to produce good quality drive cages, but their current offerings are either flimsy and/or have poor drive cooling, and should also be avoided if you would like to ensure your drives don't fail prematurely due to constant overheating.\n\nThere is one other option for a 15-drive bay setup. That is to go with the RSV-4500, not purchase hot swap drive cages, but remove the front fans. In this configuration, you still take advantage of the air filter built into the front of the flip down case fascia, and it is possible to position the drive inserts that come with the RSV-4500 case such that your SATA/SAS connection is facing rearward, while the clips to remove a drive and replace it when necessary are pointed forward. This will allow you to close the fascia and hide your bare drives, but access them easily when necessary. This approach is not for everyone, but it is a budget-conscious solution that will provide you with up to 15-drive bays in a well-cooled chassis, in spite of removing the front fans. With your drives installed in this manner, they will still be ~4\" from the 3x 120mm fans still installed in the case. For most people, with most hard drives, this will be more than adequate air flow to keep your drives reasonably cool.\n\nTo re-cap, there are several options for installing a good sized bank of 3.5\" drives in this case, and its design offers considerable flexibility.\n\nOne area that is a negative, is the documentation for the chassis is mediocre at best, and poor in some respects. For example, it fails to explain the fact that in order to depress the tabs that release the incumbent hard drive cages in the RSV-4500, you must first remove 1 or 2 screws for each cage that holds it in place. Once you have done so, the act of removing the drive cages requires one to simultaneously push down a couple of metal tabs on top of the drive cage, and apply force from the rear of the drive cage pushing it forward. Then, it will release out the front of the case. Furthermore, these acts require the removal (or at least sliding back) the top case cover. This latter point is noteworthy if you plan to install the chassis in a server rack and anything is installed directly above it. This, in turn leads me to my final point; the rails.\n\nI purchased the set of rails manufactured by Rosewill and compatible with this case. These rails are not included with your purchase of the chassis, which is a common issue with budget rackmount chassis.\n\nUnfortunately, the Rosewill rails use an old, rudimentary design that has fallen out of favor with most large, mainstream server chassis manufacturers, and for good reason. There are a lot of variety of server racks on the market now, and I found the Rosewill rail system would not install properly on my wall-mount server rack from StarTech. Specifically, the outer rail - where it wraps around the front and rear of a 4-post rack - was 1/8\" too wide. This resulted in a narrowing of the space between both inner rails of 1/4\", which was enough to make it impossible to install the Rosewill RSV-L4500 chassis in the server rack after attaching the inner rails to it and attempting to connect it with the middle rails on the rail system. Careful investigation after it became clear the unit was not going to fit into the rack revealed the flaw in the design of the Rosewill rails.\n\nI then experimented with a set of 3U/4U SuperMicro rails that use a more modern rail design, but I ran into the opposite problem. This combination resulted in an extra gap between the sides of the RSV-L4500 and the outer rails attached securely to the rack. I could have attempted the use of 5mm spacers, but this would have made the process more complicated by requiring 5mm longer screws. Furthermore, the rail screw holes in the SuperMicro inner rail did not align well with the side of the RSV-L4500 and it's pre-drilled rack rail mounting holes, meaning it would have been necessary to tap drill out multiple new threaded holes in the case for the purpose of utilizing the SuperMicro rail. In short, the LSV-4500 does not lend itself to universal rails (I also tried a set of StarTech rails, which also had alignment issues), due to the uncommon width of the server (it is rather narrow at 16.8\" wide). That being said, if your server rack is designed in such a fashion that the Rosewill rack rails are able to wrap around the edge of the server rails without pushing back into the interior of the rack, as was the case for me, then it may be an option for you.\n\nBottom line is this chassis is a solid budget choice, but it does have some drawbacks, depending on your needs. If you're willing to live with a bit of inconvenience and have a means to support it well enough in your rack (weight with all parts installed and 15 drives will be ~ 60-75 lbs.), it is a solid, economical choice for a large 3.5\" drive system for a home network NAS or media server. It's not perfect, but it is a good overall value.\n\nYMMV\n\n-------------------------------\n\nEDIT 01.14.2022:\n\nIn my original review, I inadvertently failed to clearly explain an important step if you wish to front-load your drives into the LSV-4500 case. It's a big enough pain that I should have provided more details in my original review, but here goes....\n\nThe LSV-4500 is designed such that you must insert and remove your drives from the rear of each of the three (3) groups of five (5) drives. That means in order to exchange a drive or install a new one you must do the following:\n\n1. Pull the chassis out of your rack.\n2. Remove the chassis lid.\n3. Release the drive cage and slide it partially forward.\n4. Reach to the back of the drive cage, pinch the tabs for the drive you need to remove, and slide the drive rearward.\n5. Remove the attached SATA and power cables.\nIn my original review, I mentioned there is an alternative approach where the drives may be mounted from the front. What I neglected to mention is this method involves minor hacking of the drive cages. Specifically, there are small, metal tabs toward the front of the drive cage, which are designed to stop you from accidentally sliding a drive too far forward and into the path of the front fan blades. So, if you want to be able to front-load your drives you will need to bend these tabs inward so they are flush with the inside side walls of the drive cage. It's not particularly difficult. This can be accomplished with a good set of ordinary pliers or a vice grip.\n\nA downside of front-loading your drives is it also means getting rid of the front mounted fans. There's really no point in keeping that in this configuration, as you'd have to remove them in order to get to the drives, defeating the purpose of having them be accessible from the front of the chassis. The upside is of course it means there's no need to remove the top of the chassis and manipulate the drive cage to remove or add a drive. You may think of this as a \"budget hot swap\" option if you like.\nPersonally, I don't recommend going that route, but if it suits your needs it is an option.\n\n<b>SuperMicro Drive Cage Swap</b>\n\nI've since found there is yet another option if you're interested in tinkering with the RSV-4500. It turns out that SuperMicro 5-disk mobile drive cages happen to fit very nicely in lieu of the stock drive cages. Remove the stock drive cages, insert the SuperMicro mobile drive cage with the LEDs at the top, and secure the SuperMicro cage with 2 screws on top and/or bottom. The cage will be firmly in place, and now you have just added 5 hot swap bays to your chassis.\n\nNext, you have a few possible configurations for this mod. You may then use the SuperMicro drive cage as a hot swap drive cage if you'd like. There is barely enough room to leave the 92mm fan on the rear of the SuperMicro drive cage in place, however I recommend removing it. I conducted some tests with an air velocity tester used by HVAC technicians to measure air speed and throughput, and I found with the SuperMicro 92mm fan blowing into a 120mm fan in the middle drive cage, it actually reduced the amount of air being pushed backward in the case (though I was not able to measure whether or not it improved the hydrostatic pressure). The problem is there's barely any space between the fans. You can move the middle fan rack back further by about 1/2\" via an extra set of screw holes in the side of the chassis, but either way we're talking about less than 2\" of clearance between both fans. Therefore, i recommend removing the SuperMicro 92mm fan from the back of the S.M. drive cage if you implement this design in your chassis. This also solves the problem of trying to route all your SATA cables from the back of the SuperMicro drive cage backplane to your motherboard without getting them in the way of the fans.\n\n<b>Other Information Tid-bits</b>\n\n1. You must use the stock drive cages if you want to use the front mounted fans. The fans are bolted into the fascia of the drive cages, and these are in turn designed to be recessed into the front of the case such that the locking front panel is able to close properly.\n2. There is an air filter built into the lockable front panel.\n3. The middle fan rack can be removed. It may also be adjusted very slightly by moving it back about 1/2\" in the chassis, by mounting it with an alternative set of holes on the side of the chassis."

My first introduction to them was for GPU mining a LONG time ago, if you are willing to remove the cross bar, secondary fan bar, and bays you could easily fit two E-ATX boards inside, or pack a bunch of GPUs on USB<->PCIE risers. The current design (2023) attaches the 120mm fans to the drive bays which is fine unless you plan on removing the drive bays (but want to have front-intake cooling.) These days we are buying them for gaming machines and studio/production workstations, we rack them in a cabinet from the center of the bullpen that exhausts into the attic space leaving our office space quiet and cool, the only cables coming out are 1xUSB and 1xDisplayPort per chassis. There is enough space to fit two radiators, but you may need to upgrade the case fans to exhaust the heat -- the stock fans are reasonably quiet, but the exhaust of the unit is maybe 60-70 cfm which is not enough when you have a 300-450watt GPU and 140-280watt CPU running at max, even with a climate-controlled cabinet/room with a proper barrier. For a typical backoffice server or JBOD box the stock cooling is more than adequate, and the secondary fan bar will actually ensure your drives aren't heat soaking. It's a decent chassis, and hard to beat the price. [10/10] will keep buying these 15 bay chassis for as long as Rosewill is profitable enough to make them :D"

        "review": "I replaced all of the internal fans with Noctua 80mm, and tbh...the sound difference isn't that minimal. I ended up reusing the stock fans in different parts of the case. I did two desktop conversions with these cases, and each worked out although the clearance between the onboard sata ports and the fan housing was so short, I had to remove that housing the get insert the sata cables (and I had to use differing directional angular connections (one up, one down) to fit one of the boards in. I managed to fit 8 drives (6 hdd, 2 sdd) in the drive bay area, but the gap between the drive bays and the motherboard enclosure is a bit small...fortunately, I installed a sas card with thin sata cabling (otherwise, they wouldn't have fit). Clearance between the drives and the fan enclosure is also a few mm too small...cabling coming out of the drives bends sharply against the fan grills (they're ultra thin too), and I ended up breaking one of them (finding out after reassembly...sigh). Being gentle helps there.\n\nThe one real gripe though, is that the psu compartment is too small for all of the psus I have. I got it to fit, but had to take out the mounting bracket as the psu length is an inch or so too long, so it's just wedged in there. The rails come out of the psu and run right into one of the 4 (optional) 80 mm fans, so I could only power the drives and fans off of the two rails that were far enough to the right to avoid that fan.\n\nYou will definitely need fan grills on all internal fans. The 80mm space in the rear doesn't have mounting wholes...do I used HVAC tape. It might sound janky, but its stable.\n\nZip ties area your friend as well at keeping cabling in order. I also ended up getting a Noctua low profile cooler to replace the typical monster sized desktop ones. I had to bend it a bit to get it to clear the ram, and still fit inside the 2U enclosure. Had to remove the ram heat sync's as well, but that Noctua was so large it covered the ram as well, so...I suppose that's a little bit of a positive side effect.\n\nNote to self: never throw away low profile card brackets...the generic ones I ended up using don't really fit the cards.\n\nIn total, it was worth the conversion, although with a 10G and SAS card installed. Drives are the same temperatures as they were in the desktop case (29c-35c) even under continuous load. It took a lot of hours though to get things in and fitting...taking things apart when they dont fit and re-routing cables. The second time around though had a much more clean looking result.\n\nI don't use rails...my rack has three shelves in place as-is, so they're just stacked (bolted, with spaces on the back side for the same clearance I would have gotten with rails)\n\nI think I will go for a 3U or 4U next time just for better clearances for cabling, and more GPU options (which I didn't have for these conversions)."

One of the hot swap bays/modules in my RSV-L4412U is bad, and tech support ignored my email and the phone line hung up on me. Where can I get a spare?\n\nI would advise against getting this unless Rosewill demonstrates publicly that they respond.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAlso this case came with 3 faulty SATA cables. I didn't even attempt to RMA these, I simply used spares I had on hand.\n\nDon't call, their phone number in the manual, simply hangs up after a few minutes on the phone and provides no option to hold. The email in the manual techsupport@rosewill.com looks like it words and their people can check it, but they don't somehow this gets ignored.\n\nTo get a response use RMA@Rosewill.com and even then take response with a grain of salt because they have crap internal communication.\n\nThe spare part number for the hot swap module is: RSV-SATA-Cage-34\n\nThere are retail and RMA versions of this part. I am not clear on the exact difference, but RMA representatives promised me a replacement in 1-2 business 2 weeks ago and I never received any update after that, then I learned they were out of the RMA version. To be fair to them they said there might be other delays but I expected some communication, and that team ghosted me.\n\nEventually a Rosewill representative did call me but only because of this review. They wanted to make whole situation right and offered me the retail version of the part. This rep explained the inventory difference, was puzzled about the non-responses I got but recorded (and verified them, I had all the ID numbers and timestamps). I suspect this is a different team that is less dysfunctional.\n\nDon't use this case unless you have a very reliable checksumming system on your data. I am using ZFS and its checksumming was key in identifying the faulty cables and faulty hot swap module. It is still cheap for what it is, the next cheapest solution is north of double the price. So if you can reliably find silent data errors and have a willingness to troubleshoot this can be made to work.\n\nI moved this to two stars, for now. Since my complaints are mostly around service if I do get the replacement cage I will move this review to 4 stars, because it is now clear they are trying but have crap systems in place now. I can't give 5 stars, it has been more than a month in total and they still haven't gotten me a spare.\n\nUpdate 2\n\nThis review resulted in a call to me, that resulted in a replacement for the faulty part being shipped to me. This took far too long and critical mismanagement like this is part of why I was avoiding NewEgg. Amazon isn't great but at least they respond, and now this replacement shows up in a NewEgg box?! Like they are proud of this level of service. If I had known newegg was involved. I wouldn't have ordered this to begin with.\n\nI had been boycotting newegg because of them having ripped me off a few times and likely criminal levels of shenanigans. I can't go higher than 3 stars knowing this put money into the hands of people I specifically chose not to. I don't think I will be ordering anything from NewEgg or Rosewill for several years and if you do be ready for a hassle if anything goes wrong."

Just something simple with native SATA support.\n\nThe only confusion I had was, the box hi-lights PCIe 2.0 support, and RAID 0-10. I'm thinking the packaging is wrong? Or, it's right, and the advertising material is wrong?\n\nNot much else to say, as I've only had the card for 24hrs now. This same card is available from many suppliers, with slightly different prices. I would recommend sticking with IOCREST's variation. I think the firmware is written by the supplier, and so no two cards are the same, even though the hardware is identical. (Or the hardware/JMB585 requires no firmware, and I don't have a clue about what I'm talking about). Just a recommendation though."

I'll thoroughly explain.\n\nI bought this along with another hard drive as I was out of SATA ports on my motherboard and I'd need it to use the new drive. The second day after installation of both devices, my PC hung on the desktop after a few hours of use. The cursor wouldn't move, no BSOD, no input ability whatsoever. It required a reboot. From that day on, this would occur 1-2 times a day. It varied. I work nights, and if I left my PC on all night, I'd come home to it locked up almost always. I put up with this for a month.\n\nNow, I had to wonder if it was the new hard drive or the controller as I installed them simultaneously. I decided I'd try another controller. I've been running *9 days* on another SATA controller I bought and I've had *zero* lockups. I mentioned earlier about the device causing the lockups directly/indirectly, and the reason I say that is, I have no idea if a fresh installation of windows 10 would remedy this -- but I wasn't willing to try. It could have been some kind of driver conflict or what not, or it was attributed to my particular OS installation or PC, who knows. It could also be that it's defective. Either way, it's apparent after 9 days of no lockups that the SATA controller was not working for me.\n\nI won't say whether to buy it or not, and that's why I'm giving it two stars. I'm simply posting this for anyone else that bought this controller and is experiencing the exact same problems and don't know why. It's probably this device.

It's only been in the pc for an hour tho, so no comments about longevity. Also, since I bought this after returning a LSI HBA because the LSI did not fit my case, this fits in a standard atx case. So far, very happy, 5 stars."

No front intake filter means more dust will enter the case. The perforated mesh is not fine enough to be used as a dust filter. The picture in the ad says it supports 140mm exhaust fan but only 120mm can fit. The gpu swivel fan on top of the hard drive bay seems nice but has no argb. It would have been nice if the hard drive bay had a cover. The removable plastic psu shroud is nice for those who want to show their high end psu or have air intake from the inside of the case to help with airflow. The 200mm fans has a slight wobble at any speed. It's a nice big case but the small fan mounts on the front ruined the potential high airflow. This is basically an old case back from 2010 that has rgb lighting and a glass side panel to make it look modern."

I used an ATX motherboard, 850 watt PSU, large air cooler for CPU, and a full size RTX 3080 GPU. The case is solidly constructed, made with quality materials, and easily accommodates standard size components. Being a mid size case, I'd recommend it for an average or common component set. If you're going for super compact and light, you don't need a case of this size or weight. If you're building a mega computer with huge liquid coolers and such, probably you should look for something specifically designed for that. But for the majority of self built computers, this is an awesome case that will give you zero problems with your build."

I have 200mm fans into a 2-1 splitter right to mobo. GPU fan is pointless if you have a large video card like RTX 30 series. If you get the case you will be better running fans in the position like I have. The 200mm intake fans are shrouded so 120 or 140 fans work best in front"

It is the fastest and most stable USB-C adapter of MANY I have tried and returned. With the right cable, I see speeds from an external OWC USB 3.1 enclosure, 2 SSD Raid 0 over 800mbps r/w, and around 950mbps with a 3-SSD raid. Every other card I have tried maxes out around 700mpbs, and shows no improvement with a raid spread over more disks. These speeds are still below the theoretical maximum but that may be due to the fact that this card is installed in a pcie 2.0 slot. Probably faster still if installed in pcie 3.0. Great card!

More tweaking and fixing.\n\nIf you have the cash, go for a more trusted option. Other than this it does work well."

While it does work, I can see there is a great opportunity to bend the pins if the card isn't inserted exactly straight. There is plenty of depth in the device, why not use design it to allow the card to slide in deeply so it is secure and straight before making contact with the pins?"

However it is a bear to install and the one cable put a lot of pressure on the motherboard USB3 header. The USB3 cable to connect to the header is extremely inflexible and unwieldy to cable manage. The SATA connector is only 2, which is fine I guess, but it would be better for it to have SATA 3. All of the card readers that I had cards for worked, and all of the USB ports on the front also worked at the proper speeds. if I were to go back and weigh this purchase again I would likely buy something different/skip this."

The unit is only 3\" deep so it can't attach to the 2nd line of mounting points like most 5 1/2\" devices. I used the self tapping screws to secure it as my rails have slots close to the front. Electrically and mechanically the unit is of good quality. PS: The frame is plastic - not metal, but it seems sturdy enough."

        "review": "Update 2017-08-15 Additional Testing\n\nI did some additional testing after the tear down which revealed the USB pass thru on the first port and the valid USB 3.0 hub chip. I was very curious at this point as there was no reason that this should not perform at least as well as other devices have plugged into the same 19 pin header. Additional testing shows that indeed, this device does perform above USB 2.0 speeds for the USB ports. However, the card reader is definitely USB 2.0 and the USB-C port labelled as USB 3.1 is truly a USB 3.0 port with the USB C form factor.\n\nThe issue was an add in USB 3.0 PCIe card that I had bought to add an extra 19-pin header for this device. In my testing however, I had directly connected the device to the motherboard 19pin, so I did not suspect this PCIe card as being the problem. However, it seems it was creating some angst on my PCIe bus which resulted in decreased performance of even my onboard USB. Removing that USB card allowed this USB hub to perform inline with expectations.\n\nI have added a star, though I still see the false advertising as unforgivable given that the card reader is USB 2.0.\n\nUpdate 2017-08-11 After Mfg Comment\n\nAfter the comments by the mfg, I did further investigation. I have attached photos to support that investigation. This investigation verified my assertion that the card reader portion of this device is __not__ USB 3.0 but rather is a USB 2.0 device. The card reader is supported by the Ascore AU6477DL, a USB 2.0 card reader chip, it is not capable of reading moder SD Cards at full speed.\n\nOn the other hand, the USB ports seem to be in order, with the exception of the port labelled USB3.1, which is a USB C 3.0 port. The USB C connector does not make the port USB 3.1. The first USB 3.0 port is a direct pass thru from the 19 pin header, and should have no issues. I will do some additional testing to see if this proves true. The other USB ports including the USB-C port are connected to an internal USB 3.0 Hub supported by a VIA VL813, a legitimate USB 3.0 hub chip. There is no explanation for the low performance that I saw. I will do additional testing.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nI wanted to like this. I needed it to work well, it is a flop. I have always seen Kingwin as an excellent brand, albeit a bit overpriced. At this point I didn't care. I am desperate for a high quality high performance card reader insert. This is not it.\n\nImmediately my hopes were shattered after examining it out of the box. There were 3 connectors, a 19pin for the USB3.0 and USBc ports. A Sata connector for the eSata port and a USB2.0 header for the card reader. Yes a USB2 header connector for the card reader ports meaning that performance of the card reader maxes out at USB 2.0 speeds 480 Mbps or 60 MB/s. I thought hmph.. well ok at least I will go from 2 front facing USB3.0 to 3 + a USB C style USB 3 port. So I installed anyhow and booted up and started to benchmark some SD cards, the main reason I need the card reader. I knew that using the card reader was pointless so I stuck with my Saitec USB3 reader and started running tests. The Saitec plugged into one of the previous 2 USB 3.0 ports, plugged into the same 19 pin motherboard header has no problem sustaining 90MB/s reads and writes on quality SD cards. So I connected the Saitec and ran a benchmark on what should have been a very fast card, and it capped around 40MB/s. I tried three other cards, with the same results. I tried the same cards in a HooToo USB C reader plugged into the USB C port and again the same results.\n\nI purchased a PCIe card with a 19pin header to work with this. Unfortunately my computer doesn't seem willing to take another PCIe card, but if you need one this looks like a good option.\nhttp://amzn.to/2wIEzsd\n\nI do recommend this Saitec USB 3.0 reader though, it has worked very well for all but the most cutting edge SD cards.\nhttp://amzn.to/2vjHXvE\n\nConclusion. The card reader will only connect to a USB 2.0 header. The USB 3.0 ports seem to be managed by a USB 2.0 hub. All in all this was a waste. I'll have to try again."

One 19-pin USB 3.0 header cable, one Molex power connection, one eSATA cable and a USB 2.0 harness that connected the various card reader slots on the panel to the motherboard. Everything seemed to work until the computer went into standby. Touching the mouse or keyboard seemed to wake the computer, but not the video monitor. Had to do a hard reset (not a soft power off) to reboot the computer so I could see something. Played with various BIOS settings, changing video output from native to add-n video adapter...nada. Unplugging the 19-pin connector from the motherboard fixed the blank monitor problem, but cancelled out any USB 3.0 support to the panel. Was going to send it back, but found there are not a lot of 5.25 front panels to choose from. Made one last attempt to get it to work by unplugging the 4-pin Molex power connector which appears to be the fix. It did not affect the USB 3.0 capability far as I can tell. Don't know if it affects the eSATA function. Going to order an add in card with a 19-pin USB connection and spare my motherboard from possible damage."

Not a manufacturer I’ve used before but figured for the price and the reported speeds I thought it was value (I always expect the speeds to be lower than reported so didn’t want a 5,500 drive that comes up short). The ps5 reported this drive was running at 6,100 so above the minimum requirements. I transferred 300GB+ from console memory to the drive, took just over 3mins. Can’t think of an occasion where the drive will be transferring a higher load so shouldn’t be any issues with over heating. However the ‘graphene heat shield’ is literally a heat proof sticker and not a heat sink (as it appears from the image, it’s a clever illusion which makes the sticker look 3D) in any event I did not have any issues with performance or thermal throttling while transferring the entire console memory to the drive. I have ordered a heat sink in any event, as maybe I’ll get closer to the reported 7,300 speed but this is mainly for peace of mind more than anything."

After testing the drive on Userbenchmark and CrystalDiskMark, I have attached my finding via the images. The benchmark score are encouraging. You may find three different test outputs in the attached images. Namely; Default test, Peak Performance+Mix Test, and Real-world Performance+Mix.\n\nA bit about my setup:\nGigabyte X470 Aorus Ultra Gaming Motherboard (PCIe 3.0) Hence the drive performance is limited due to the board's capability and not this drive. I plan to soon upgrade my motherboard and may update the benchmark scores for your reference later.\n\nPros:\nRuns cool under full load. I did not see it go past 43 degree Celsius in all of my testing. (Important to note that the drive slot is right below my GPU)\nFor PCIe 3.0 slot, its performance is comparable to other known brands.\nPackage included the screw and a tiny screwdriver.\n\nCons:\nFor backward compatibility, Fanxiang can consider adding a motherboard support screw as this drive is 2280 and most motherboards only drop a motherboard screw on 22110 point. I could not screw the drive to the mainboard and had to use the heat sink to keep it in place.\n\nSince I received the drive today, I may update the operational use-related findings later.

        "review": "Encore peu connue en France, Fanxiang est une marque chinoise qui propose des SSD à des prix particulièrement compétitifs. Mais pas cher ne signifie pas médiocre pour autant. Le SSD S880 a subi 88 heures de tests rigoureux ainsi que 5 tests stricts histoire de garantir sa résistance et sa fiabilité sur le long terme. Le SSD dispose d’une garantie de 5 ans et Fanxiang annonce une endurance de 2800 TBW.\n\n🔳 Caractéristiques détaillés du SSD S880 4TB :\nModèle: 5880\nInterface: M.2 2280 (protocolo NVMe 1.4)\nContrôleur SSD : MAP1602A from MaxioTech\nModules Mémoire : 232-layer TLC NAND flash (Made by YMTC)\nTempérature de fonctionnement: 0°C-70°C\nTempérature de stockage : -40°C-85°C\nPoids: 0.045g\nTaille: 80*22*2.5~3.4mm\nCapacité: 4To\nService après-vente: 5 ans\n\nInstallé dans un boitier externe USB-C Thunderbolt 3 (40Gbps) en tant que disque de sauvegarde 4TB pour mon Macbook Pro (oui je sais c'est overkill), ce disque annonce des performances vraiment excellentes (7300MB/s en lecture séquentielle et 6800MB/s en écriture séquentielle). Hélas je n'ai jamais réussi à les atteindre puisque le TB3 même à 40Gbps n'est pas assez rapide.\n\nVoici mon feedback sur ce disque SSD S880 4TB:\n✅ RAPPORT QUALITÉ/PRIX IMBATTABLE à ce niveau de capacité/performance\n✅ Équipé d’un autocollant de dissipation thermique au graphène, cela permet une dissipation de la chaleur et empêcher le SSD d’atteindre des températures élevées.\n✅ Format M.2 2280 compact tout ce qu'il y a de plus classique.\n✅ Il exploite à merveille l’interface PCIe 4.0 NVMe 4X pour offrir des débits extrêmement élevés...\n✅ ...tout en conservant une consommation et une chauffe maîtrisée (ça chauffe quand même pas mal hein, on ne va pas se mentir)\n✅ Vitesse annoncée jusqu’à 7300 Mbps en lecture séquentielle et jusqu’à 6800 Mbps en écriture séquentielle. De mon côté, j'étais plutôt sur environ la moitié des chiffres annoncés (en USB-C donc). Je n'ai pas pu vérifier sur un PC en PCI 4.0 4X.\n✅ Débits théorique 13 fois supérieurs à ceux d'un SSD SATA.\n✅ 2800 TBW !!\n✅ Garantie 5 ans.... 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼\n❌ Pas de cache DRAM ! Mais il y a un pseudo cache SLC pour les bursts d'écriture\n❌ Une marque encore très jeune (les S880 sont sortis en Avril 2023, c'est très récent...). Il y a peu de recul encore sur la fiabilité long terme. D'où le fait que je l'ai mis en disque de sauvegarde, car il sera peu sollicité, et si un jour une sauvegarde n'aboutit pas car le disque est défaillant, je pourrai toujours le changer rapidement, plutôt que de perdre toutes les données d'un disque principal en production ^^\n\nLe mot de la fin : Sur mes premiers essais depuis plusieurs mois, les performances restent stratosphériques pour un disque utilisé en externe en plus. C'est pour moi un excellent achat. Je vous le conseille."

        "review": " È un SSD con dissipatore di calore, adatto per Ps5, serve per aumentare gli 825 GB disponibili della Ps5 che si esauriscono con pochi giochi.\n\nÈ un SSD del modello M2 PCle 4.0. con una velocità dichiarata di lettura e scrittura di 7300 MB/s, che poi rivelereanno effettivamente essere circa 6500 MB/s.\n\nVeniamo alle fasi di montaggio dell'SSD:\n\nSi prende uno dei due cuscinetti termici, si rimuove la pellicola e lo si posiziona sulla base del dissipatore di calore, poi si mette sopra l'SSD con il chip verso l'alto e si mette l'altro pad termico a coprire la parte superiore dell'SSD. Fatto questo si prende il dissipatore che si posizionerà sopra il pad termico e si preme verso il basso cosi da fissarsi.\n\nAll'interno della confezione troviamo 5 viti nere, ne vanno usate 4 per bloccare l'SSD al dissipatore con il piccolo giravite in dotazione.\n\nFatto questo è tutto pronto e dobbiamo smontare la ps5 prendendola in posizione orizzontale, facendo scorrere prendendo gli estremi e sollevandola leggermente. Davanti a voi dovete avere il retro della ps5, messa in posizione orizzontale dovete farla scorrere verso sinistra. È una procedura che richiedere una leggera forza all'inizio e pazienza, anche se non riuscite subito, prendetevi un attimo e riprovate con calma senza farvi prendere dalla foga.\n\nRimosso il pannello, in alto troverete un alloggiamento per l'SSD aggiuntivo. Rimuovete la vite, il coperchio e inserite l'SSD completo di dissipatore nel giusto verso. Con la rondella e la vita presenti fissiamo il tutto e richiediamo coperchio e Ps5.\n\nUna volta accesa la Ps5 apparirà il messaggio che vi dirà di aver rilevato il nuovo SSD e se formattarlo. Cliccate su formatta, fatto questo vi indicherà la velocità massima di lettura e sarà pronto all'uso.\n\nLa procedura non è difficile, richiede molta pazienza ma è fattibile per tutti, nulla di trascendentale. Adesso c'è tantissimo spazio e non bisogna più cancellare giochi e salvataggi.\n\nPRO\nPs5 finalmente completa in tutto, installazione intuitiva, SSD capiente\n\nCONTRO\nVelocità effettiva inferiore a quella dichiarata\n\nAdesso la mia Ps5 ha lo spazio necessario per poter giocare con serenità senza stare lì a rimuovere o fare calcoli su cosa salvare o cancellare.\n\nPeccato per la velocità dichiarata che non viene raggiunta e per questo motivo lo valuto 4 stelle ma resta comunque un valore di tutto rispetto.\n\nSe volete una Ps5 capiente e funzionale con più giochi installati sopra, questo SSD può fare al caso vostro, va bene per entrambe le versioni di Ps5.\n\nSpero di esservi stato utile."

        "review": " 👋 Ciao lettori, oggi vi parlo di questo SSD targato Fanxiang che mi ha lasciato molto colpito!\n☁️ Personalmente ho acquistato la variante S770 da 2TB\n\n📢 PRIME IMPRESSIONI:\nPackaging con l'SSD, nulla più nulla meno, dissipato passivamente che promette teoricamente delle ottime performance, ma sarà vero? Controlliamolo insieme!\n\n⚙️ SPECIFICHE TECNICHE:\nFanxiang lancia questo prodotto con un bel pacchetto di specifiche, partiamo innanzitutto da un PCIe 4.0 che garantisce alla PS5 di leggerlo (PS5 non è compatibile con nessun NVMe che non sia almeno PCIe 4.0), poi troviamo ben 2GB di DRAM nel caso della variante da 2TB della Sk Hynix, chip che promettono bene, affiancato da una NAND di YMTC ed un controller di InnoGrit entrambi assolutamente niente male, a livello di componentistica usata per quanto mi riguarda, c'è da stupirsi considerato il prezzo!\n\n🚀 MA QUANTO E' VELOCE?:\nMantiene la promessa fatta, infatti grazie al PCIe 4.0 affiancato da delle componenti evidentemente di livello, raggiunge senza problemi i promessi 7000MB/s in Read e 6600MB/s in Write, assolutamente niente male!\n\n🎮 PS5 READY:\nLa PS5 digerisce tranquillamente questo SSD ed una volta in game, le prestazioni che fornisce sono assolutamente equiparabili al SSD nativo della Play, carica molto velocemente i giochi e grazie alla DRAM li sposta anche molto velocemente tra SSD Esterno e interno o viceversa.\n\n🟨 Nota: Il profilo del dissipatore passivo è ottimizzato per PS5, questo significa che lo shielding che devi rimontare per chiudere il vano del inserimento SSD su PS5 si chiude tranquillamente anche con il dissipatore installato.\n\n🔥 DURABILITA':\nFanxiang garantisce ben 1400TBW di durabilità (ovvero 1400TB di scrittura su disco), che sono tantissimi, facendo finta che ogni gioco per PS5 sia di 100GB, dovreste scaricare 100GB di giochi per 14 MILA VOLTE.\n\n🕒 3 MESI DOPO E QUALITA' PREZZO:\nAd oggi non ho avuto nessunissimo problema con questo disco e mi sento di essere pronto a consigliarvelo, le performance che ho ottenuto sono state davvero ottimali soprattutto per il prezzo pagato, per quanto mi riguarda ne vale la pena.\n\n🏁 FACCIAMO IL PUNTO:\nUn disco di un brand emergente che contro ogni aspettativa (considerando i trascorsi dei nuovi brand di SSD orientali), si comporta benissimo ed ha velocità assolutamente adeguate a quello che promette.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5"

It looked simple, so I ordered this Linkmore SG500 SS drive after wading through the many SS drives available. When I received it, I popped the old drive out. Popped the Linkmore drive into the old drive enclosure. Slid it back into the laptop. Super easy. Then I loaded an Ubuntu CD into the laptop and installed Ubuntu onto the Linkmore drive. Everything went smoothly. And boot up and app responses are now much quicker. Very happy!"

They are not as fast as other SSDs and therefore I don't recommend them for gaming or putting an operating system on one. The price is reasonable and although you don't get a full 256GB they are good enough for what they do."
